Introduction to E-Skin: A Brief Chronology   Human skin is highly intuitive, making it easy to neglect the  complexity of the largest sensory organ in our bodies Our skin  is the physical barrier through which we interact with our sur- roundings, allowing us to perceive various shapes and textures,  changes in temperature, and varying degrees of contact pres- sure To achieve such high sophistication in its sensing capabili- ties, several different types of highly specialized sense receptors  are embedded within our skin These  receptors ﬁ rst transduce information gen- erated by physical contact into electrical  signals and subsequently send it to the  central nervous systems for more com- plex processing The collected signals are  eventually interpreted by the somatosen- sory cortex, [ 1 ]  permitting us to successfully  navigate our physical world with ease   The effort to create an artiﬁ  cial skin  with human-like sensory capabilities is  motivated by the possibility of such large,  multi-sensory surfaces being highly appli- cable for autonomous artiﬁ cial intelligence  (eg, robots), medical diagnostics, and  replacement prosthetic devices capable  of providing the same, if not better, level  of sensory perception than the organic  equivalent Endowing robots with sensing  capabilities could extend their range of  applications to include highly interactive  tasks, such as caring for the elderly, [ 2 ]  and  sensor skins applied on or in the body could provide an unprec- edented level of diagnostic and monitoring capabilities [ 3 ]  An  artiﬁ cial skin with such sensory capabilities is often referred to  in the literature as sensitive skin, smart skin, or electronic skin  (e-skin)   Although the primary function of human skin is mechanical  force sensing, electronic versions can be augmented with addi- tional capabilities In artiﬁ cial platforms, researchers can incor- porate chemical and biological sensors onto ﬂ  exible substrates  Targeted species can be sensed in either gas or liquid media  using such electronic noses (e-noses) or electronic tongues  (e-tongues), respectively Other sensing modalities (ie, tem- perature) and other functionalities (ie, biocompatibility, self- healing and self-powering) are also important and will be cov- ered in subsequent sections    11     The 1970s to 1990s   The prospect of creating artiﬁ  cial skin was in many ways  inspired by science ﬁ  ction, which propelled the possibility  of e-skin into the imagination of both the general public as  well as the scientiﬁ c community One of the ﬁ  rst science ﬁ  c- tion books to explore the use of mechanical replacement  organs was Caidin ’s  Cyborg  in 1971, on which the famed   Six Million Dollar Man   television series about a man with    Human skin is a remarkable organ It consists of an integrated, stretchable  network of sensors that relay information about tactile and thermal stimuli to  the brain, allowing us to maneuver within our environment safely and effec- tively Interest in large-area networks of electronic devices inspired by human  skin is motivated by the promise of creating autonomous intelligent robots  and biomimetic prosthetics, among other applications The development of  electronic networks comprised of ﬂ exible, stretchable, and robust devices that  are compatible with large-area implementation and integrated with multiple  functionalities is a testament to the progress in developing an electronic skin  (e-skin) akin to human skin E-skins are already capable of providing aug- mented performance over their organic counterpart, both in superior spatial  resolution and thermal sensitivity They could be further improved through  the incorporation of additional functionalities (eg, chemical and biological  sensing) and desired properties (eg, biodegradability and self-powering)  Continued rapid progress in this area is promising for the development of a  fully integrated e-skin in the near future    DOI:  101002/adma201302240   M L Hammock,[+] Dr J B-H Tok, Prof Z Bao   Department of Chemical Engineering 381 N South Axis Stanford University    Stanford  ,   CA    94305  ,   USA

 [ 44 ]  Ion gels  are composites of polymers and ionic liquids that demonstrate  exceptionally high capacitance on the basis of the forma- tion of an electrical double layer [ 45 ]  The capacitance is largely  insensitive to the thickness of the dielectric and is expected to  be constant with strain, potentially making them suitable for  strain-tolerant systems Recent improvements in mechanical  robustness have made ion gels a more viable option for struc- tural applications [ 46 ]      213     CNT-Based Active Materials   CNTs have been remarked for their exceptional electronic  and mechanical properties, as well as their chemical sta- bility Near ballistic transport can be achieved in defect free  tubes, with reported charge carrier mobilities (  μ  ) as high as  10,000 cm 2  V −1  s −1  [ 47 ]  Several recent reviews have discussed the  properties of CNTs in more detail [ 48 ]  Therefore, we highlight  only the most important characteristics for e-skin below   For e-skin applications, facile synthesis techniques that are  reliable and scalable are of utmost importance for the produc- tion of large-area, low-cost devices To this end, CNTs can be  produced through various high-volume, low-purity techniques,  including arc discharge [ 49 ]  and laser ablation [ 50 ]  CNTs that  are produced in bulk are compatible with large-area solution- processing techniques, which can be utilized to achieve puri- ﬁ cation as well as directly to deposit the CNT onto ﬂ  exible  microstructured elastomeric dielectrics for highly sensitive  capacitive pressure sensors [ 18 ]  and has developed a composite  conductive elastomer exhibiting repeatable self-healing and  mechanical force sensing capabilities [ 19 ]  Other groups have  developed stretchable optoelectronics, including light-emitting  diodes (LEDs) [ 20 ]  and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) [ 21 ]  for inte- gration with e-skin A timeline outlining the major milestones  towards the development of e-skin is depicted in  Figure    1     In the following sections, we ﬁ rst discuss strategies and mate- rials used in fabricating ﬂ exible and stretchable e-skins (Section  2), followed by a discussion of tactile sensors (Section 3) and ﬂ ex- ible chemical and biological sensors (Section 4) We subsequently  address other important qualities for e-skin applications (Section  5), describe some highly integrated demonstrations of e-skin (Sec- tion 6), and ﬁ nally we provide an outlook for this ﬁ eld (Section 7)      2     Design Considerations for E-Skin   Human skin can be considered as a performance benchmark  for the development of artiﬁ  cial tactile systems Important  considerations for the development of e-skin are the choice of  materials used in its fabrication and the ability to confer the  mechanical properties of human skin (low modulus, stretcha- bility and ﬂ exibility) into its artiﬁ cial counterpart The following  section will discuss some of the materials and techniques fre- quently used to accomplish these goals    21     Materials   One deﬁ ning characteristic of human skin is that it is mechani- cally compliant, allowing it to ﬂ ex and stretch without incurring  physical damage The skin ’s low mechanical modulus allows it  to transmit the physical properties of the objects with which we  interact to the myriad of receptors buried under the protective epi- dermis layer Therefore, in the development of artiﬁ cial skin, the  materials chosen for its fabrication should reﬂ  ect the ﬂ exibility  and stretchability of natural human skin Equally important is the  ability of human skin to self-repair, and artiﬁ cial skin should be  imbued with this quality, allowing it to last a lifetime [ 28 ]    To achieve these properties, the choice of materials is critical,  and technological advancements in e-skin have been largely  possible through the development of new materials and pro- cessing methods for the fabrication of stretchable and ﬂ exible  devices In addition to mechanical compliance, good electrical  performance and compatibility with large-area processing  techniques are important to create highly functional, low-cost  devices Nanomaterials often provide an advantageous combi- nation of physical properties and cost Below, we survey several  of the most commonly used materials for the fabrication of sen- sors and supporting electronics in e-skin We also recommend  several recent reviews that cover materials for stretchable elec- tronics in greater detail [ 29 ]     211     Substrates   Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has overwhelmingly been used  for the fabrication of e-skin and other stretchable electronics  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywiley

     Graphene-Based Active Materials   A second carbon allotrope, graphene, can be used as an active  material in e-skin devices Graphene consists of an atomi- cally-thin layer of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms, [ 59 ]  and pos- sesses remarkable carrier mobility (  μ   ∼ 20,000 cm 2  V −1  s −1 ) [ 60 ]   Depending on how it is processed, graphene can be used as a  semiconductor or conductor Recent reviews on graphene dis- cuss its properties more thoroughly, [ 61 ]  and we discuss only the  properties relevant to e-skin below   Graphene can be produced through a variety of high-yield  techniques suitable for the fabrication of e-skin devices These  techniques include bulk growth with CVD and chemical exfoli- ation from bulk graphite CVD growth of graphene on metallic  surfaces [ 62 ]  or epitaxial growth on SiC surfaces [ 63 ]  allows for the  high-yield production of large sized ﬁ  lms [ 62b ]  with excellent  electronic qualities However, such ﬁ  lms must be transferred  to plastic substrates, [ 62a, 65 ]  which can introduce defects and con- taminants [ 64 ]  and limit device sizes, [ 65 ]  although there have been  recent reports of large-area transferred ﬁ  lms [ 66 ]  Graphene can  also be produced from the reduction of chemically exfoliated  graphene oxide sheets [ 67 ]  (reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) by  chemical, [ 68 ]  thermal, [ 69 ]  photothermal, [ 70 ]  or electrochemical [ 71 ]   means The rGO method leads to the low-cost, mass produc- tion of graphene sheets that are compatible with solution-pro- cessing techniques, such as spray coating, [ 72 ]  vacuum ﬁ ltra- tion, [ 73 ]  dip-coating, [ 74 ]  spin-coating, [ 75 ]  and inkjet printing [ 76 ]   for direct deposition on large-area, ﬂ exible substrates for e-skin  applications     215     Nanowire (NW)-Based Active Materials   NWs of many materials (eg, Si, zinc oxide (ZnO), gallium  arsenide (GaAs), and cadmium selenide (CdSe), among others)  form another class of active materials that has been pursued  for the fabrication of e-skins [ 23 ]  However, the high cost associ- ated with production of NW devices, either through top-down  or bottom-up strategies, [ 77 ]  limits their applicability in large- scale e-skin devices Furthermore, the fabrication of NW-based  devices has historically been restricted owing to the inability to  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6002 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde changes in resistance, [ 114 ]  and composites of CNTs, AgNWs, and  polymers have shown conductivity as high as 5710 S cm −1  [ 102 ]   Since CNTs tend to aggregate strongly, composite preparation  requires highly optimized mixing processes [ 20b,102,113c ]  or use  of predetermined morphologies [ 113d,114 ]  Aerogels [ 115 ]  and other  low-density structures [ 116 ]  of CNTs and graphene [ 117 ]  can also  exhibit conductivity and exceptional mechanical properties and  have the potential to overcome the drawbacks of creep and  relaxation that are inherent to elastomeric materials CPs are  attractive because of their compatibility with polymer matrices  and low cost CPs used in compliant electrodes have included  PEDOT:PSS, [ 104d,108 ]  PANI, [ 104a ]  PPY , [ 105 ]  and P3HT [ 120 ]  CPs  have demonstrated conductivities up to 1000 S cm −1  at 0%  strain and 100 S cm −1  at 180% strain [ 104a ]  A challenge associ- ated with the use of CPs is their sensitivity to environmental  conditions, which results in the degradation of their electrical  characteristics over time [ 118 ]  However, this can be mitigated  through chemical and morphological tuning [ 121 ]  Overall, the  ﬁ eld of stretchable conductors has progressed rapidly thanks  to improved methods for optimizing the dispersion state of  ﬁ llers      22     Strategies to Achieve Stretchability   An important characteristic of human skin is its ability  to stretch and flex with bodily movements without incur- ring damage While arrays of flexible electronics have been  developed by using very thin plastic substrates, [ 122 ]  stretch- able devices have been more difficult to achieve, and new  processes and materials are often required [ 123 ]  In gen- eral, stretchable devices can be fabricated by developing  devices comprised of intrinsically stretchable materials or  by appropriate geometrical arrangement of conventional  materials    221     Intrinsic Stretchability   Intrinsically stretchable devices may have an advantage in  applications where full area coverage and coplanar devices  are desired

 For example, stretchable displays with high  pixel density could beneﬁ t from stretchable light emitters,  which may require intrinsically stretchable drive transistors  Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable devices could realize a  cost advantage by direct printing onto elastomeric substrates  Recent progress in stretchable materials development has  enabled a number of intrinsically stretchable devices Cao  et al developed transparent transistors that could withstand  up to 3% strain using CNTs for both the electrodes and the  active material and PDMS as the dielectric layer [ 124 ]  Lee  et al demonstrated a transistor with graphene electrodes and  active layer that showed reliable operation while stretching  up to 5% for 1000 cycles [ 125 ]  A more detailed description of  issues relevant to stretchable graphene-based transistors is  available by Ahn and coworkers [ 126 ]  Intrinsically stretchable  light- emitting electrochemical cells have been reported by Yu  et al [ 20a ]  By replacing the traditional brittle active layer of LEDs  with a liquid-like electrochemical emitter and using electrodes  composed of CNTs embedded in a polymer, the light emitters  150% while maintaining good electrical performance  owing to the ability of its 2D packed planes to be pulled  apart [ 94b,99a,100 ]  The plastic deformation of P3HT could  allow for one-time stretching, but reversible elasticity would  require crosslinking the semiconductor to provide a restoring  force [ 97 ]  While P3HT itself is easily deformed, composites of  P3HT with a small-molecule semiconductor for use in solar  cells have demonstrated minimal strain tolerance [ 94a ]  P3HT  homogeneously dispersed in PDMS has been reported as a  stretchable dielectric, [ 98 ]  and similar methods for creating  stretchable semiconductors could be considered Com- pared to homogeneous dispersions, OS NWs [ 103 ]  dispersed  in an elastomeric matrix [ 119 ]  may have improved electrical  properties     217     Stretchable Conductors   While conductive elastomers have been used for years as pres- sure sensitive elements, [ 101 ]  the rise in popularity of stretchable  electronics has fueled the intense development of conductive  elastomers with characteristics suitable for high-performance  electronics The ideal stretchable conductor would maintain high  conductivity over a large range of strains, allowing reliable oper- ation during stretching [ 15b,102 ]  Owing to the insulating nature of  elastomers, conductivity is typically achieved through the intro- duction of conductive materials The performance of composite  conductors is intimately dependent on the morphology and  interaction between the matrix elastomer and the ﬁ ller mate- rial, [ 104 ]  with large ﬁ ller concentrations typically associated with  enhanced elastic moduli and reduced strain at break [ 102,104a,105 ]   In this respect, highly anisotropic ﬁ  llers are advantageous  because their low percolation threshold allows good elec- trical properties at low ﬁ ller concentrations [ 15b,102 ]  In many  cases, ﬁ ller aggregation reduces conductivity, [ 104d,106 ]  although  controlled aggregation into conductive pathways can reduce the  required ﬁ ller loading and improve conductivity [ 104a,107 ]   Compatibility with patterning methods is important for  device fabrication, and stretchable conductors that can be  printed [ 20b,102,108 ]  or photo-patterned [ 111 ]  have been developed  Park et al demonstrated an innovative low-cost method of  printing highly stretchable circuits using electrospun elasto- meric ﬁ bers combined with metal NPs [ 32 ]    Owing to the exceptionally high conductivity of metals,  metallic spheres, [ 109 ]  ﬂ akes, [ 102,108 ]  and wires [ 110 ]  have shown  excellent performance in stretchable conductors In general,  metals can be incorporated into conductive matrices by mixing  pre-formed particles with a matrix polymer [ 102,109a ]  or by growth  of the metal particles in the polymer matrix using organome- tallic precursors [ 32,111 ]  or low-energy ion implantation [ 104b,109b ]   Liquid metals embedded in elastomeric channels have demon- strated some of the highest performances, but can be costly [ 112 ]   Carbon black (CB) is one of the least expensive conductive  ﬁ llers available, but owing to its low conductivity ( ≈05 S cm −1 ),  it is only suitable for limited applications, such as pressure  sensitive rubbers and electrodes for artiﬁ cial muscles [ 104b ]   Owing to their high conductivity and large anisotropy, CNTs  have been one of the most successful ﬁ llers for stretchable  conductors [ 15b,20b,102,109a,113 ]  Aligned forests of CNTs embedded  in an elastomer have been stretched up to 300% with only small  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywiley

 [ 147 ]  Pop-up structures have allowed Si nanoribbons  to be stretched to ≈100% strain, [ 147b ]  many times higher than  the buckled, adhered nanoribbons Similarly, the selective adhe- sion of serpentine patterns to the substrate allows twisting and  extension out of the plane of the substrate, reducing the strain  in the material and affording a larger range of stretchability [ 14a ]     Buckling methods are attractive because of their compat- ibility with conventional high-performance materials Recently,  Chae et al reported a hybrid method of making stretchable  transistors in which stretchable electrodes were combined with  a buckled alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) dielectric layer, providing repro- ducible performance up to 20% strain [ 148 ]  ZnO transistor  arrays stretchable up to 5% have been fabricated by transfer- ring ZnO transistors onto prestrained substrates [ 149 ]  Although  the stretchability of these devices lags behind what would be  required for e-skin, the low-cost and good stability of oxide  semiconductors make them an attractive option for further  development   The research group of John Rogers has pioneered many  of the techniques to make buckled devices from traditional  high-performance inorganic semiconductors and conductors  Many of their devices use inorganic NWs, nanoplatelets, and  nanomembranes obtained by etching thin layers of material  from multilayer [ 141a ]  or bulk wafers [ 150 ]  They have adhered inor- ganic nanostructures to stretchable substrates using transfer  processing [ 151 ]  Such transfer methods can achieve cost-effec- tive large-area coverage by distributing active elements fab- ricated in a dense array over a larger area through successive  transfer steps [ 150a,151a,152 ]  by automated systems, [ 150a,152 ]  and can  be used to make three dimensional circuits by adding multiple  layers [ 151b ]  The group has formed semiconductor devices into  buckles, [ 141a ]  pop-up structures, [ 14a,147b ]  and serpentine mesh  layouts [ 137 ]  to demonstrate a range of functionalities In Sec- tion 6, we describe several highly integrated devices based on  this technology, and a more comprehensive discussion can be  found in recent review articles [ 14c,154 ]     Rigid Device Islands Linked by Stretchable Interconnects  :  High-performance stretchable systems can be realized by con- necting conventional rigid device islands with interconnects  that have been made stretchable using patterning or buckling  The strain in the substrate is highly localized near the edges  of the device islands [ 155 ]  As a result, interconnects experience  greatly increased strains near the edges of device islands that  can lead to failure of the devices [ 156 ]  Interconnects that are  not adhered to the substrate (that is, pop-up) can be used to  alleviate this strain, [ 157 ]  as can grading the substrate’s elastic  modulus near the device islands [ 135d,158 ]  Using low-modulus  substrates is important for minimizing strain in the device  islands, and patterning the substrate into mesas can further  reduce the island strain [ 155,157 ]  Wagner and coworkers have  created functional device islands by fabricating amorphous  Si FETs directly onto elastomeric substrates and connecting  them with Au metallization [ 159 ]  Lacour and coworkers have  similarly fabricated OFETs directly on PDMS substrates [ 160 ]   By positioning the transistors on high-modulus regions of the  minimal change in the conductivity, [ 135a ]  and multiple itera- tions of serpentine patterning further improved stretchability  up to 300% [ 137 ]  Patterning a ﬂ exible substrate into a discon- tinuous ﬁ lm is an attractive method of imparting stretchability  on the device level because it requires minimal changes to  established fabrication methods With this technique, strain  is accommodated by twisting out of the plane of the distortion  (Figure   2 d) [ 15a,136 ]     Buckling : Depositing a high-modulus thin ﬁ  lm onto a pre- strained elastomeric substrate results in the formation of  wrinkled (buckled) ﬁ lms upon relaxation of the system, [ 138 ]  as  energy minimization induces the formation of sinusoidal wavy  patterns in the ﬁ lm [ 139 ]  Uniaxial prestrain leads to the forma- tion of linear buckles ( Figure    3 a), [ 21a,140 ]  while biaxial prestrain  results in a herringbone bucking pattern (Figure   3 b) [ 141 ]  With  buckles present, a device can be stretched to the value of the  prestrain without inducing considerable strain in the active  components Similar results to buckling can be achieved by  structuring an elastomeric substrate with waves prior to ﬁ lm  deposition, eliminating the need for prestrain [ 132,142 ]  Buck- ling has been applied to a wide variety of materials, including  inorganic semiconductors, metals, [ 143 ]  composites, [ 144 ]  gra- phene, [ 145 ]  and CNTs

 [ 162 ]  Recently, there has been intense interest  in designing robots that can work in less-structured environ- ments by collecting information about their surroundings to  make appropriate responses [ 12,162 ]  Such capabilities would  allow them to work in close quarters with humans and com- plete more complicated and dynamic tasks (eg, providing basic  services to elderly people or undertaking dangerous rescue  missions) [ 2,163 ]  However, highly functional tactile sensing will  be required to improve the operation speed and effectiveness  of current robotic technology [ 164 ]  In addition to robotic appli- cations, efﬁ cacious tactile sensing arrays could transform the  medical ﬁ eld Tactile sensors integrated into prosthetics could  allow amputees to regain considerable functionality, and touch- sensitive sensor skins could be useful in augmenting sur- gical gloves [ 165 ]  or for continuously measuring the health of  patients [ 3 ]    The human tactile sensing system allows us to navigate our  surroundings amply, and knowledge of its working mechanisms  can be used as inspiration for effective design of electronic  substitutes Tactile sensing within the skin relies on neuronal  sensor elements called mechanoreceptors, which are embedded  at different depths below the skin surface and respond to forces  on different timescales Fast adapting (FA) mechanoreceptors  sense dynamic changes in force and respond with intense sig- nals during the application or removal of forces [ 166 ]  By contrast,  slowly adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors are able to sense static  forces by responding continuously during prolonged stimula- tion The density of mechanoreceptors depends on the location  in the body and ranges from approximately 241 cm −2  in ﬁ n- gertips to 58 cm −2  in the palm, [ 166b,167 ]  resulting in a resolution  of approximately 1 mm in the ﬁ  ngertips [ 168 ]  In humans, data  processing starts in the individual receptors, where the stim- ulus is digitized [ 169 ]  Signals from groups of receptors are pro- cessed en route to the brain, [ 170 ]  where ﬁ nal data interpretation  occurs [ 166b,169 ]  This breakdown of tactile signal processing helps  to reduce the brain ’s data-processing requirements [ 166b,169 ]   With this signal processing pathway, the body can sense pres- sures greater than ≈10 kPa [ 171 ]  with a temporal resolution of  20–40 ms, [ 172 ]  and vibrations can be sensed at frequencies up  to 800 Hz [ 166a ]    The mechanical properties of skin have a pronounced effect  on its tactile sensing capabilities Mechanical compliance  improves grip by promoting an understanding of an object’s  shape and increasing contact area with the object [ 173 ]  The skin ’s  morphology has evolved to beneﬁ  t tactile sensing, and the  skin ’s ridges enhance sensitivity [ 174 ]  by concentrating forces into    T a b l e  1      Summary of the properties of human skin and corresponding  requirements for e-skin   Parameter Human Skin Requirement for E-Skin Spatial resolution 1 mm [168] 1–2 mm [163]  Temporal resolution 20–40 ms [172] 1–10 ms [163]  Working range >10 kPa [171] 1–1000 g [163]  Hysteresis High Low [163]  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6006 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde and graphene have also attracted signiﬁ cant interest because of  their unique electrical and mechanical properties, [ 189b ]  and ani- sotropic composites or ﬁ lms of CNTs have displayed exceptional  sensing properties [ 198b,198c ]  Several reviews discussing the use  of CNTs in tactile sensors are available [ 189b,199 ]  Metal particles  with sharp protrusions are highly effective as conductive ﬁ  llers  in piezoresistive composites, [ 200 ]  and the concept has been  commercialized by Peratech Ltd [ 201 ]  The protrusions concen- trate the electric ﬁ  elds in the device, enhancing the effect of  pressure on the tunneling current through the material [ 192b,202 ]   On application of compressive or tensile strain, the particles  move closer together, thereby decreasing the resistance by up  to 12 orders of magnitude [ 202a ]  Piezoresistive components have  been incorporated into highly ﬂ  exible and stretchable devices  using electrical connections made from liquid metal, [ 203 ]  stretch- able helical electrodes, [ 204 ]  and stitched metallic electrodes [ 205 ]      312

     Capacitance   The capacitance ( C ) of a parallel plate capacitor is given by:   C  =   ε   0   ε   r  A / d , where   ε   0  is the free space permittivity,   ε   r  is the  relative permittivity,  A  is the area, and  d  is the distance between  electrodes [ 206 ]  Three of these variables (  ε   r ,  A , and  d ) are sensi- tive to changes in strain The change in  d  is commonly used  to measure normal forces, [ 16,22 ]  while changes in  A  are typically  used to measure shear forces [ 207 ]  The change in   ε   r  can be used  to measure forces using specially designed materials, [ 208 ]  but  this method has not been widely pursued A major advantage of  capacitive sensors is that their governing equation is simple, [ 209 ]   which simpliﬁ es device design and analysis Capacitive sensors  for tactile sensing have demonstrated high strain sensitivity,  compatibility with static force measurement, and low power  consumption [ 206,207b,210 ]  However, since  C  is proportional to   A , reducing the pixel size of these devices for miniaturization  reduces the capacitance and the signal-to-noise ratio [ 206 ]  Fur- thermore, capacitive sensors are susceptible to interference  from external sources [ 211 ]  Dobrzynska et al have compared  and commented on the characteristics of capacitive devices in  a recent review [ 207b ]    When changes in  d  are used to determine normal forces,  dielectrics with low moduli show improved sensitivity owing  to increased deformation for the same applied force [ 207b ]  Our  group recently demonstrated stretchable and transparent  capacitive sensors fabricated by sandwiching a PDMS dielec- tric between two sets of PEDOT:PSS [ 133c ]  or CNT-based [ 22 ]  elec- trodes ( Figures    4 a,b) Ecoﬂ ex silicone was used as the dielec- tric material because of its exceptionally low modulus Highly  compliant capacitive sensors have also been reported by other  groups using stretchable electrodes composed of CNTs, [ 212 ]   metal NWs, [ 144,213 ]  and Au thin ﬁ lms [ 214 ]  Takamatsu et al have  also used an interesting ﬁ ber-based method to make compliant  tactile arrays [ 215 ]     The sensitivity and response time of capacitive tactile sen- sors incorporating elastomeric dielectrics is limited by the  incompressible and viscoelastic nature of rubbers [ 18 ]  The per- formance of these sensors can be improved by using a highly  compressible dielectric, and air gaps are commonly used to  increase compressibility [ 209,211,216 ]  However, forming air gaps  typically requires complex patterning processes, and the low  mechanism The change in resistance can be derived from  several factors, including changes in: 1) the geometry of the  sensing element, 2) the resistivity of a semiconductor owing  to changes in band structure, 3) the contact resistance ( R  c )  between two materials, and 4) the resistivity of a composite  owing to changes in interparticle separation   The resistance ( R ) of a material is given by  R  =   ρ L/A , where    ρ   is the resistivity,  L  is the length, and  A  is the area The  effect of geometry on the piezoresistance is dominant when   ρ    remains constant, but  L  and  A  change with strain The sensi- tivity of a strain sensor is referred to as the gauge factor ( GF ),  and the ideal  GF  value for sensors based on a change in geom- etry is 2 [ 178 ]  Piezoresistivity derived from a change in the band  structure of a material has been observed in Si, [ 179 ]  CNTs, [ 180 ]   and graphene [ 181 ]  OS also possess piezoresistive properties,  although through a different mechanism Typically,   μ   decreases  with strain [ 95a ]  owing to an increase in the intermolecular or  intergrain separation [ 182 ]    The  R  c  between two conductors changes with applied pres- sure owing to the change in contact area between the materials  and is related to the force by  R  c  ∝  F  −1/2  [ 183 ]  This power law  dependence between  R  c  and  F  is advantageous in that it pro- vides high sensitivity at low pressures as well as a large working  range Sensors based on contact resistance have low tempera- ture sensitivity, readily tunable ranges, fast response speeds,  and are easily made ﬂ exible [ 184 ]  However, they typically show  undesirable drift and hysteresis [ 185 ]    To make large-strain sensors, several groups have pursued  ﬁ bers coated with conductive materials When woven into a  fabric,  R  c  between ﬁ bers changes with tensile force [ 186 ]  The  incorporation of ZnO as a conductive material in ﬁ  bers [ 187 ]  has  led to large values of  GF  ( GF  ≈ 116), which are comparable to  those of traditional strain gauges based on piezoresistance in  Si ( GF  ≈ 200) [ 187b ]  The use of aligned ﬁ lms of CNTs have also  shown exceptional performance as strain gauges, capable of  measuring strains as large as 200%, as opposed to randomly ori- ented CNT ﬁ lms that cannot be strained past a few percent

 [ 188 ]    Piezoresistive polymer composites have been extensively  investigated as strain- and force-sensitive materials because  of their low cost and easy integration into devices Piezoresist- ance in composite materials depends on the composition, mor- phology, and strain range of the system [ 189 ]  Mechanisms for pie- zoresistance in composites include: 1) the modiﬁ cation of ﬁ ller  resistivity owing to band structure changes, [ 190 ]  2) the modiﬁ ca- tion of tunneling resistance between ﬁ llers, [ 189a ]  and 3) the break- up and reforming of percolating pathways [ 191 ]  Unlike stretchable  conductors, piezoresistive composites usually show the highest  performance near the percolation threshold of the ﬁ ller material  in the elastomer matrix [ 192 ]  To avoid irreversible alteration of the  sensing characteristics, the ﬁ ller must be well dispersed and well  adhered to the matrix [ 192a,193 ]  Generally, conductive composites  exhibit large hysteresis, [ 194 ]  and large variations in their elec- trical properties with temperature [ 195 ]  However, de la Vega et al  recently showed that the temperature sensitivity of CNT compos- ites can be tuned by changing the concentration of CNTs, pos- sibly leading to temperature stable sensors [ 196 ]    CB has long been used as a conductive ﬁ ller in strain-sensing  materials owing to its low cost and abundance, [ 193a ]  and its pie- zoresistive properties agree with developed models [ 197 ]  CNTs  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6007wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde piezoelectric strain constant ( d  33 ) [ 219 ]  Owing  to the high sensitivity of piezoelectric sensors  to dynamic pressure and their fast response  speed, they are often used to measure the  vibrations associated with slip, [ 220 ]  and their  transient sensing capabilities resemble those  of the RA receptors in human skin [ 166a ]  How- ever, piezoelectric materials exhibit drift in  sensor response over time and have unreli- able static sensing properties   Piezoelectric behavior can occur in crystals  that have anisotropic unit cells (piezoelec- trics) or in macroscopically separated regions  with different charges (piezoelectrets) Pop- ular inorganic piezoelectric materials include  lead zirconate titanate (PZT) [ 221 ]  and ZnO [ 222 ]   Dispersing inorganic NPs in polymer  matrices can achieve the mechanical compli- ance necessary for e-skin [ 223 ]  Poly(vinylidene  diﬂ uoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are  widely used owing to their ﬂ exibility and ease  of processing compared to ceramics While  the  d  33  coefﬁ cient of PVDF is considerably  lower than that of commonly used ceramics,  additives can improve its performance [ 224 ]   Although PZT and PVDF represent proto- typical piezoelectric materials, many others  have been demonstrated, [ 221a,225 ]  and the  development of new materials [ 226 ]  and form  factors [ 227 ]  is an active area of research Pie- zoelectric materials are also pyroelectric, which means that a  voltage can be induced owing to a temperature change Pyro- electricity can be used to measure temperature, but is a signiﬁ - cant confounding factor in most piezoelectric tactile sensors   In contrast to piezoelectrics, which rely on molecular dipoles,  electrets and ferroelectrets utilize the change in ﬁ  xed macro- scopic dipoles in a material to generate a voltage [ 228 ]  Charges  are formed by the breakdown of gas in the voids during the  application of large electric ﬁ elds [ 229 ]  The void volume can be  tuned to optimize the  d  33  coefﬁ cient by reducing the Young’s  modulus of the material [ 230 ]  In contrast to molecular piezo- electrics such as PVDF, the temperature dependence of the  ferroelectret response is very small [ 17,228 ]  Furthermore, owing  to the small transverse piezoelectric coefﬁ cients, devices can be  ﬂ exed with minimal change in their functionality [ 231 ]  Excellent  reviews on ferroelectretic systems provide more information on  this subject, [ 228,232 ]  and applications of piezoelectric materials in  devices will be described in subsequent sections     314     Optics   Optical sensors convert a tactile input into an electrical output  using light as an intermediate These sensors consist of a  light source, transmission medium, and detector The modu- lation of light intensity through force-sensitive waveguides [ 233 ]   or ﬂ exible optical ﬁ  bers [ 234 ]  has been used to fabricate optical  sensors

 While these ﬁ  ber-optic sensors had low wiring com- plexity, exceptional linearity, and negligible drift, they were  not stretchable The use of elastomeric waveguides enables  permittivity of air leads to reduced values of  C  and a corre- spondingly low signal-to-noise ratio Foamed elastomers intro- duce compressibility in a manner that does not dramatically  complicate device fabrication [ 217 ]  However, the voids in con- ventional foams typically have diameters in the range of tens  or hundreds of micrometers, resulting in small  C  and corre- sponding low signal-to-noise ratios [ 16 ]    We have developed a microstructured rubber dielectric for  pressure sensors that provides excellent sensing properties [ 18 ]   Using anisotropic KOH etching on a photolithographically pat- terned Si wafer, we created molds with either linear or pyram- idal impressions onto which we cast and cured an elastomer  to create the structured dielectric with well-deﬁ ned protrusions  (Figure   4 c) The air pockets within the material allowed elastic  deformation of the dielectric material, overcoming the viscous  time response observed with bulk elastomers [ 18 ]  The excellent  control over the dielectric structure allowed for large compress- ibility with small  d , resulting in an exceptional sensitivity of  ≈055 kPa −1  at low pressures and a good signal-to-noise ratio  (Figure   4 d)     313     Piezoelectricity   Piezoelectricity refers to the ability of a material to generate  a voltage in response to an applied force The force causes a  change in the length and separation between dipoles in the  material, [ 218 ]  leading to the build-up of compensating charges  on the electrodes The ability of the material to convert  normal forces into electrical charges is quantiﬁ ed using the     Figure 4    Stretchable and highly sensitive capacitive sensors developed by our group a) Image  of a passive matrix array of stretchable, skin-like pressure sensors b) Image of the measured  pressure distribution from a stimulus Adapted with permission [ 22 ]  Copyright 2011, Macmillan  Publishers Ltd c) Depiction of a dielectric layer patterned with pyramidal structures fabricated  using a Si mold d) Sensitive response of the pressure sensor to the weight of a ﬂ y (≈20 mg)  Adapted with permission [ 18 ]  Copyright 2010, Macmillan Publishers Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6008 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde tion [ 243 ]  Antennas fabricated on elastomeric substrates using  metals [ 244 ]  and CNTs [ 245 ]  have been used to measure pressures,  and large tensile strains have been measured using stretchable  microﬂ uidic-based sensors with liquid metal conductors [ 246 ]   For example, Whitesides and coworkers demonstrated a wire- less device that showed a change in frequency from 153 to  0738 Hz as the device was stretched from 0 to 120% strain [ 247 ]   The robustness and compliance of these devices makes them  inherently compatible with e-skin      32     Device Structures and Functionalities    321     Fabrication Methods   The transduction methods described in Section 31 can be  implemented using several fabrication methods Si-based  technologies have been well developed and show excellent  sensing characteristics [ 248 ]  The challenges in fabricating  large-area, ﬂ  exible arrays can be mitigated by transferring  devices to ﬂ  exible substrates, allowing dimensional multipli- cation [ 249 ]  However, the drawbacks of high cost and fragility  have yet to be addressed [ 166b,250 ]  Many groups have turned to  polymer micromachining, [ 211,216,251 ]  which is more cost effec- tive and provides ﬂ  exible devices Polymer micromachining  typically involves using photolithography [ 216a,250,251b,252 ]   or molding [ 216,251a ]  to pattern device structures, such as  air gaps for capacitive sensors [ 211,216 ]  or resistive strain  gauges [ 252 ]  Large-area solution processing [ 22 ]  and printing  technologies [ 20b,253 ]  have gained popularity as low-cost, high- throughput fabrication techniques     322     External Interactions   In many cases, device arrays are encapsulated within an  elastomer to protect them from mechanical harm and envi- ronmental exposure, as well as also to provide conformal  contact with stimuli However, as with human skin, an  elastic coating reduces the positional resolution and sensi- tivity of the array [ 210,254 ]  and introduces hysteresis into the  measurements

 [ 166b ]  Many sensor designs include a “bump” or  force localizing protrusion (FLP) on the surface of a sensing  system to modify or to localize a force distribution FLPs act  similarly to the ridges in skin that are essential for improving  sensitivity and measuring texture [ 177b ]  FLPs can increase  sensitivity, [ 251a ]  convert normal forces into tensile forces  ( Figure    6 a), [ 250,251a,252 ]  and convert shear forces into normal  forces for facile measurement (Figure   6 b) [ 211,216b,251b,255 ]       323     Slip, Texture, and Hardness Sensing   In their simplest form, most of the transduction methods  described in Section 31 measure tensile or compressive forces  However, human skin senses a multitude of tactile inputs,  including normal, tensile, and shear forces, in addition to vibra- tions To ascertain complex information about shear forces,  hardness, and texture, device structures with additional func- tionalities are required Dedicated shear sensors include resis- tive sensors made by embedding Si strain sensors in PDMS, [ 256 ]   and capacitive sensors made by embedding a vertically-oriented  stretchable devices to be created, [ 235 ]  and our group has devel- oped a stretchable pressure sensor based on a PDMS wave- guide [ 236 ]  Light was produced by an LED positioned at one end  of the waveguide and detected by a photodetector at the other  end ( Figure    5 a) The device displayed excellent pressure sensi- tivity (02 kPa −1 ), and the ability to distinguish the application  and removal of a 30 mg weight Koeppe et al demonstrated  pressure sensors with elastomeric waveguides by using a  large-area array of organic photodetectors to measure the light  out-coupled from an elastomeric waveguide (Figure   5 b) [ 237 ]   Similarly, the pressure-induced coupling of light into a wave- guide has been employed [ 238 ]     Monitoring the deformation of highly compliant coatings  can be achieved using arrays of light emitters and detectors  The orientation of an array of reﬂ ective chips [ 239 ]  on the sur- face of an elastomeric covering changes on deformation, which  modiﬁ es the amount of light collected by the array’s detectors  Rossiter et al [ 240 ]  used LEDs as both the source and the detector  to simplify the design Vision-based sensors have attracted sig- niﬁ cant attention owing to their low wiring complexity They  monitor the movement of reference objects, such as colored  markers within a compliant material using a camera [ 241 ]   Maheshwari et al [ 242 ]  developed a sensor in which mechanical  transduction occurred within the light source With applied  pressure, the local light emission from the material increased  and was monitored with a photodetector array, attaining a reso- lution of 40  μ m [ 242 ]  While optical devices have many promising  characteristics, light generation is power-intensive, [ 166b,239b ]  and  low-power devices may be difﬁ cult to achieve     315     Wireless Antennas   The frequency at which a wireless antenna operates depends  on the dimensions of the device, and strain can induce a  change in resonant frequency as a consequence of deforma-    Figure 5    Working mechanism of optical pressure sensors a) Modulation  of light intensity through a waveguide Reproduced with permission [ 236 ]   b) Outcoupling of light from a stretchable waveguide to a large-area  detector Reproduced with permission [ 237 ]   Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6009wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde resistance, and the authors could distinguish the type of force  from the recovered signal Temperature is often a confounding  factor in pressure sensing systems, and Tien et al have used  an innovative biasing method to discriminate between tem- perature and force signals in a FET-based sensor [ 260 ]  These  devices allow sensing of multiple stimuli with minimal wiring  complexity; however, distinguishing the different inputs can be  challenging In cases where stimuli are distinguishable, more  complex analysis is required to extract the desired information    As described in Section 323, multiple stimuli such as  normal and shear forces can be discriminated using a pixel  consisting of clustered sensing elements While this method  produces easily distinguishable signals in a compact form, it is  applicable only to certain combinations of stimuli Arrays of dis- crete devices with different functionalities can also be used to  measure multiple stimuli

 This method most closely resembles  that of human skin, in which receptors are tuned to respond to  forces in certain directions, [ 261 ]  and dedicated receptors sense  hotness and coldness [ 262 ]  Integrating multiple sensing types  can also be useful to correct for confounding factors [ 15b,263 ]   This method has the advantage of providing simple outputs for  each sensor element, but requires a high density of pixels to  sense many parameters Taking inspiration from natural skin,  Park et al embedded microﬂ uidic channels ﬁ  lled with liquid  metal at different depths within an e-skin to sense different  stimuli [ 264 ]  Similarly, Hosoda et al dispersed strain and vibra- tion sensors at different depths through a sensor skin to collect  complex information [ 258b ]       33     Device Integration and Readout    331     Array Addressing   Our senses of vision and hearing are facilitated by a small  number of localized sensors By contrast, tactile sensing  electrode in PDMS [ 257 ]  A more common approach is to imple- ment multiaxial sensing in which a single pixel can distinguish  between forces in multiple directions As described in Section  322, shear forces can be converted to normal or tensile forces  using FLPs to modify pixel distortion The resulting force dis- tribution can be monitored using a cluster of normal or ten- sile force sensors Information on the direction of the force is  extracted by comparing the relative signal from the elements  in the cluster This approach has been implemented with  capacitive [ 216b,251b,254 ]  and piezoresistive systems [ 250,251a,252,255 ]    Sliding an object along human skin induces vibrations that  indicate slip, and a similar mechanism is used to determine  texture High-speed tactile sensors can be used to sense the  vibrations responsible for relating information on slip and  texture, [ 210 ]  and the dynamic response of PVDF is particularly  well suited for this application [ 258 ]  Additionally, hardness dis- crimination can be accomplished using two sensing elements  with different compliances [ 259 ]  Peng et al showed that the  relative signals from the two sensing elements can distin- guish the modulus of a test material with accuracy down to  01 MPa [ 259a ]      324     Simultaneous Sensing of Multiple Stimuli   To simulate the multifunctional nature of skin, e-skin must  sense many parameters simultaneously The tendency of  simple, discrete devices to respond to multiple stimuli can  be advantageous for this purpose For example, stretchable  capacitive sensors are typically sensitive to both strain and  pressure, [ 22,144,212b,213 ]  and are inﬂ uenced by human proximity  owing to modiﬁ cation of the fringe ﬁ  elds [ 212b,214a ]  Using very  thin elastomeric substrates, Pang et al created a ﬂ  exible and  highly functional resistive pressure sensor based on the  R  c   between interlocking pillars of metal-coated elastomer ﬁ  bers  ( Figure    7 ) [ 25 ]  The application of normal, shear, and torsion  forces caused an increase in contact area and a decrease in     Figure 6    Use of FLPs to modify a tactile sensor’s interaction with its surroundings a) Localization of strain for measurement of norma l forces with  strain gauges Adapted with permission [ 251a ]  Copyright 2011, IOP Publishing Ltd b) Conversion of shear forces to facilitate measurement with capaci- tive normal force sensors Adapted with permission [ 251b ]  Copyright 2011, IOP Publishing Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6010 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde able change in the source-drain current ( I  DS ) with pressure [ 270 ]   The mechanism of force sensitivity is likely related to a  change in the trap states near the electrodes [ 270b-d ]  The effect  of applied force can be tuned by changing the morphology  of the semiconductors, with larger grain sizes showing more  pronounced sensitivities [ 95b,182a ]  Bonﬁ glio and coworkers have  pursued  cost-efﬁ cient, large-area arrays by developing printed  devices [ 253a,271 ]  However, these pressure-sensitive transistors  have the drawbacks of long response times and signiﬁ  cant  hysteresis [ 270c,270d   ]  On the basis of similar mechanisms, OFETs  have also been investigated as active strain sensors that are  capable of sensing strains in the range of several percent [ 272 ]    The devices described thus far have utilized the strain   sensitivity of the semiconductor active layer itself

 The research  groups of Someya and Javey have independently developed  FETs in which piezoresistive rubbers have been integrated  in series with the source electrode to create tactile sensor   elements Pressure applied to the resistive rubber directly  modulates  I  DS , and the voltage applied at the gate ( V  G ) pro- vides the switching necessary for active-matrix readout Both  groups have exploited the use of low-cost processing methods  with different active materials: Someya and coworkers have  used pentacene OFETs ( Figures    8 a,b), [ 15,26a,273 ]  while Javey  and coworkers have used NWs and CNTs (Figure   8 c) [ 23a,136b ]   A key consideration in pixel design is that the resistance of  the  pressure sensitive material must be larger than that of the  transistor in the on state Chao et al reported the use of a  vertical transistor, simplifying the process of integrating the  pressure-responsive rubber [ 274 ]  As described in Section 311,  we have developed a microstructured dielectric layer showing  exceptional pressure sensitivity We further investigated the  use of such a dielectric layer in an OFET with a single crystal of  rubrene serving as the semiconductor (Figure   8 d) [ 18 ]  On appli- cation of pressure,  I  DS  increased proportionally to the change  in  C  of the dielectric In addition to amplifying the signal, the  requires a multitude of sensors distributed over a large area,  and developing methods to collect and process such a large  amount of information has been a persistent challenge in  the ﬁ eld The simplest strategy for device readout is direct  addressing, in which each device is contacted by a separate  connection Good temporal resolution can be achieved with  this method, but large arrays quickly lead to an unmanageable  number of connections [ 265 ]  Passive matrices consist of two  sets of parallel electrodes with the sensing elements located at  the crossing points of perpendicular electrodes Appropriate  readout mechanisms can mitigate the tendency of passive  matrices to produce erroneous readings, [ 266 ]  but the disad- vantage of slow readout speed persists An active matrix uses  transistors to address each pixel While this design increases  the complexity of the integrated array, it allows for rapid ele- ment addressing with relatively few wires Additional beneﬁ ts  of active matrices include minimal crosstalk between sensor  elements and low power consumption [ 26,177a ]  Complete elimi- nation of sensor wiring requires wireless transfer of data and  power [ 267 ]  and has been pursued by several groups [ 268 ]  For  example, Shinoda et al wrapped a ground coil around a hard  surface and wirelessly interrogated sensing elements that were  distributed throughout an elastic skin [ 269 ]      332     Transistor Integration   Integration of tactile sensing with transistors is advantageous for  making active matrix arrays and implementing local processing  capabilities For example, the ability of transistors to amplify  signals may eliminate the need for signal ampliﬁ cation in the  control system, reducing the required processing capabilities  Strain-sensitive transistors can be realized by integrating a strain- sensitive material as one of the components within the device   A number of groups have investigated the effect of mechan- ical stimulation on pentacene OFETs and observed a repeat-    Figure 7    Detection of multiple stimuli with a device composed of interlocking pillars a) Conceptual image of the ﬂ exible device fabricated using very  thin elastomeric substrates b) Multiple deformation modes of the device allow for sensing of normal, shear, and torsion forces Adapted with permis- sion [ 25 ]  Copyright 2012, Macmillan Publishers Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6011wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde (Figure   9 c) [ 253b ]  All components of their integrated system were  printed using only ﬁ ve materials The devices were responsive  to both pressure and temperature and could be used to track  hand gestures      333     Modular Designs   In addition to the signal conditioning that can occur at the  device level in transistor-integrated devices, data processing  can also occur at an intermediate level to reduce the volume  of data reaching the control computer This strategy is similar  to human skin, where data collected from groups of neurons  is processed en route to the brain [ 166b,169 ]  Modular approaches  involve creating arrays that can be subsequently combined  to create an even larger array

 By implementing computing  capabilities into each module, signal processing or data anal- ysis can occur within the sensor network itself [ 280 ]  Modularity  also provides the ability to expand a sensor network to meet the  needs of any application [ 216a,217,239b ]        4     Chemical and Biological Sensors for E-Skin   We have discussed in Section 3 how e-skin can be endowed  with tactile sensors Here, we describe how the functionality  device converts the signal from capacitance to  I  DS  for simpli- ﬁ ed measurement By replacing the rigid transistor with a  ﬂ exible device, our group has recently demonstrated highly  ﬂ exible OFET pressure sensors for medical applications [ 3 ]   Kim et al used a similar concept to investigate the effect of  different dielectric patterns [ 275 ]     Piezoelectric materials have been integrated with transistors  using several methods Bauer and coworkers developed ﬂ exible  optothermal sensors by electrically coupling a discrete piezo- electric element to the gate electrode, the advantage being that  the signal transduction and signal readout mechanisms could  be designed independently [ 276 ]  By contrast, Lee and coworkers  integrated piezoelectric ﬁ  lms directly as the dielectric, [ 277 ]   and have demonstrated pressure-sensitive transistors with  an exceptionally high electromechanical coupling coefﬁ cient  ( Figure    9 a) [ 260 ]  An alternating current (AC) biasing method  was developed to decouple the pyroelectric and piezoelectric  effects by exploiting the temperature sensitivity of the semi- conductor [ 278 ]  Hsu et al reduced the parasitic capacitance to  minimize crosstalk between adjacent devices [ 26b ]  By coupling  a ferroelectretic material to gate electrode of a transistor, Graz  et al created ﬂ exible transistor-integrated devices with the capa- bility of measuring both static and dynamic forces, depending  on the measurement mode [ 17 ]  To overcome the temperature  sensitivity of piezoelectrics, Graz et al also integrated bifunc- tional composites that were selective to temperature and pres- sure into the gate electrode (Figure   9 b) [ 279 ]  To demonstrate the  potential of high-throughput processes, Zirkl et al fabricated  arrays of PVDF copolymer sensors addressed with electro- chemical transistors and connected to electrochemical displays     Figure 9    Transistor-integrated tactile devices based on piezoelectric  transduction methods a) An OFET using a high-performance nano- composite as a pressure-sensitive gate dielectric Adapted with permis- sion [ 260 ]  Copyright 2011, American Chemical Society b) A pixel consisting  of separate pressure and temperature sensing elements, composed of  a selectively poled composite active layer Adapted with permission [ 279 ]   Copyright 2009, American Institute of Physics c) Printed piezoelec- tric pressure sensor array employing electrochemical drive transistors  Adapted with permission [ 253b ]      Figure 8    Tactile sensor elements with integrated transistors a)  Schematic structure of a sensor element created by incorporating a pres- sure sensitive rubber into the source electrode of an OFET b) Optical  image of a pressure-sensitive element Reproduced with permission [ 273 ]   c) Stretchable array of pressure-sensitive CNT transistors fabricated  using large-area processes Reproduced with permission [ 136b ]  Copyright  2011, American Chemical Society d) OFET with a pressure-sensitive  microstructured dielectric Reproduced with permission [ 18 ]  Copyright  2010, Macmillan Publishers Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6012 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde reader to these sources for further information Various NWs  have also been used extensively for chemical and biological  detection [ 285 ]   However, in addition to the issues surrounding  their macroscale integration and high cost, there are relatively  few demonstrations of ﬂ exible NW chemical sensors, [ 286 ]  and  they will therefore not be covered in this review    41     CNT-Based Sensors   On rigid substrates, CNT-based sensors have been utilized to  fabricate extremely sensitive chemical [ 284a,287 ]  and biological [ 288 ]   sensors Their sensitivity results from their remarkably high sur- face-to-volume ratio and ability of each surface atom to contribute  the sensing response CNT sensors for chemical and biological  analytes can be broken down into two main categories: those  for the detection of gas-phase analytes and those for the detec- tion of liquid-phase analytes

 As gas sensors, CNT sensors have  been demonstrated as chemiresistors, [ 287g ]  transistors, [ 284a,287b ]   and capacitors [ 287e ]  In aqueous environments, they are primarily  used as transistors [ 288a–c,288e   ]  for the electrical detection of ana- lytes and as electrochemical electrodes for the detection [ 288d ]  of  redox-active species such as H 2 O 2  and nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide (NADH) Here, we discuss several examples of ﬂ ex- ible CNT sensors in both the gas and liquid phases    411     Gas Phase Detection with CNT-Based Sensors    Chemiresistors : Flexible chemiresistive sensors with CNTs as the  active sensing matrix have been demonstrated for the detection  of gaseous analytes, including NH 3 , [ 289 ]  NO 2 , [ 290 ]  and EtOH, [ 291 ]   as well as panels of these gases [ 292 ]  Flexible chemiresistors  have also been used for the detection of organophosphonate  nerve agents (dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) and diiso- propyl methylphosphonate (DIMP)), [ 293 ]  and the deposition of  palladium NPs (PdNPs) has allowed for the detection of H 2   as well ( Figure    10 ) [ 294 ]  The detection limit for these sensors is  typically quite low (1–50 ppm), and their response time is rapid  (<1 min), though it can vary with analyte concentration, leading  to very slow responses for dilute samples [ 294a,294b   ]  Additionally,  recovery times can be quite slow (≈several minutes), and regen- eration is often incomplete unless elevated temperatures [ 290b ]   or UV irradiation [ 290a ]  are used To implement these regenera- tion techniques in e-skin, it would be necessary to incorporate  a microheater or UV light source, which would further compli- cate device architectures    In general, these chemiresistive sensors have a nonspe- ciﬁ c response to targeted analytes This lack of speciﬁ  city  is undesirable for e-skin applications, as it is impractical to  exclude all interferent analytes from the operating environ- ment However, several attempts have been made to increase  speciﬁ city Cattanach et al used a chemiselective polymer bar- rier to enhance selectivity for nerve agents over other gaseous  analytes [ 293b ]  for which their CNT ﬁ lms have previously demon- strated sensitivity [ 292a ]  PdNPs have been used to enhance the  sensitivity for H 2  over other analytes; however, such sensors  still exhibit a low level of cross-reactivity to other gases at low  H 2  concentrations [ 294a ]  Furthermore, owing to the deactiva- tion of the PdNPs by O 2 , these sensors were operable only in  of e-skin can be augmented beyond the capabilities of human  skin through the integration of chemical and biological sen- sors There is already high demand for miniaturized, port- able, and inexpensive sensors for the monitoring of a broad  range of compounds, including environmental pollutants,  chemical and biological warfare agents, and medically rel- evant biomarkers [ 86,90a,90b ]  To meet this demand, electronically  based chemical and biological sensors for gas (eg, e-nose) and  liquid (eg, e-tongue) phase analytes have been demonstrated  on rigid substrates using CNTs, graphene, inorganic NWs, and  organic materials as the active sensor element The continued  production of low-cost chemical and biological sensors via high- throughput techniques and translation of this technology onto  ﬂ exible substrates will be attractive for integration with e-skin   In general, chemical and biological sensing with electronic  devices relies on the direct transduction of a binding event or  reaction into a change in the conductance of the device [ 90a,90b   ]   The introduction of particular chemical or biological species  that are capable of interacting with the device (either nonspecif- ically through serendipitous interactions or, speciﬁ cally through  the use of receptor groups) perturbs the local charge environ- ment, resulting in a change in conductance These electronic- based sensors offer label-free, portable, and real-time detection  without the need for bulky supporting electronics that are the  status quo for optical detection methods [ 90b ]    Electrochemical electrodes, chemically sensitive resistors  (ie, chemiresistors), and transistors are the devices primarily  used for chemical and biological sensing Electrochemical elec- trodes are comprised of a single conducting layer in which a  receptor element is typically encapsulated, and are sensitive to  the generation of redox active species in solution These electro- chemical sensors operate using three electrodes (ie, working,  auxiliary, and reference) in solution The large size of these elec- trode arrays makes them impractical for integration with e-skin  unless subjected to signiﬁ cant miniaturization Chemiresistors  consist of a pair of electrodes (ie, source and drain) deposited  on a semiconducting material Changes in resistance are meas- ured on exposure of the chemiresistor to a targeted analyte

  Transistors include an additional gate electrode that is capaci- tively coupled to the semiconductor via a dielectric layer and  that acts as an electronic switch and signal ampliﬁ er Since tran- sistor-based sensors are a combination of sensing elements and  ampliﬁ ers, they offer higher sensitivity than chemiresistors, as  a small change of effective  V  G  owing to the presence of an ana- lyte may lead to pronounced variation in  I  DS  [ 281 ]    Traditionally, chemical and biological sensors have been built  on rigid substrates, which restricts their utility for ﬂ  exible or  stretchable e-skin applications While the use of ﬂ  exible inter- connects allows for the possibility of transforming sensors built  on rigid substrates into stretchable sensing networks, these  devices are inherently fragile Recently, chemical and biological  sensors have been fabricated on plastic substrates However,  it should be noted that most studies have only demonstrated  the ﬂ exibility of such sensors and not on their stretchability  In this review, we will focus exclusively on sensors that have  been demonstrated on ﬂ exible plastic substrates The subject of  chemical and biological sensing with CNTs, [ 282 ]  graphene, [ 283 ]   and organic materials [ 86,90,284b,c ]  on rigid substrates has already  been extensively and recently reviewed, and we direct the  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6013wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde which include H + , [ 297 ]  glutamate, [ 298 ]  and other biomolecular  analytes [ 297b,299 ]  One particular application that CNT-based  e-skin sensors could be particularly well suited for is blood glu- cose determination in diabetic patients Several glucose sensors  have been developed on ﬂ exible substrates [ 300 ]  that are capable  of detecting glucose down to 05 m M  (linear range of 05 to  25 m M ) [ 300b ]    The reported ﬂ  exible transistors are comprised of CNT  networks rather than individual CNTs and were fabricated  entirely using solution deposition techniques These allowed  for facile and large-area fabrication approaches, which are  highly advantageous for e-skin applications Selective detec- tion was demonstrated by incorporating bioreceptor groups  on the CNTs through chemical grafting However, the use of  biological receptor groups limits the longevity of such sensors  and mandates more stringent storage conditions and may not  be feasible for e-skin applications Furthermore, these sensors  relied on solution gating, in which the gate electrode is sus- pended in an electrolyte Unfortunately, these solution gates  are not easily miniaturized, presenting a foreseeable obstacle  for their integration in e-skin devices Additionally, the effect  of bending on the detection of aqueous-phase analytes has  yet to be investigated This parameter will be important in  understanding the feasibility of using these sensors in e-skin  applications    Electrochemical Electrodes  : Compared to carbon paste and  glassy carbon electrodes, CNTs offer great advantages as elec- trochemical sensors owing to their ability to mediate fast  and direct electron transfer with redox active enzymes, thus  preventing overpotential and surface fouling [ 282a ]  The most  relevant molecules that could be monitored with ﬂ  exible CNT  electrodes are glucose (owing to its critical role in diabetes  management) and H 2 O 2  (owing to its role as a reactive oxygen  species and a chemical messenger in biological processes) The  electrochemical detection of glucose with ﬂ exible CNT elec- trodes has been achieved through the immobilization of glu- cose oxidase (GO x ), which can convert glucose into gluoconic  acid and H 2 O 2  [ 301 ]  The lowest detectable glucose concentration  reported using GO x  as the recognition element was reported  to be 001 m M ; [ 301a,301b   ]  however, these sensors demonstrated  a linear detection range that was lower than the concentration  relevant for diabetes monitoring Chiu et al reported a hybrid  inert environments as they demonstrated worse performance  and lower sensitivity under ambient conditions [ 294b,294c   ]  These  restrictions are impractical for e-skin applications, and the  development of sensors that are capable of operation in air  should be pursued   Understanding the effect of strain on the sensing signal is  quintessential to the development of gas sensors for e-skin  applications Most reports indicate a moderate (2–18%) change  in sensitivity on bending [ 290b,292a,294 ]  The long-term stability  of such devices is also important for e-skin applications

 Su  et al reported little variation after 84 days of continuous ana- lyte exposure, [ 294c ]  while Jeong et al found that the resistance  of their sensor had little change over a 6-month period [ 290b ]   However, Parikh et al found that the sensitivity and reproduc- ibility of their sensors declined after repeated cycles of expo- sure and regeneration [ 292a ]  Bending fatigue is another area of  interest for e-skin applications Sun et al found that there was  a 13% decrease in sensitivity after 1,000 bending cycles [ 294a ]   The ability to maintain a stable sensing response despite long  storage periods and mechanical stresses will be critical for the  development for sensors that can be integrated into e-skin, and  CNT-based devices show promise in these areas    Transistors : Despite their enhanced sensitivity over chemire- sistors, relatively few ﬂ  exible CNT transistors for gas sensing  have been reported Chen et al developed a CNT transistor for  2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection with a limit of detection  of 8 ppm [ 295 ]  This detection limit was an order of magnitude  better than corresponding transistors made from ZnO NWs,  demonstrating the enhanced sensitivity of atomically-thin CNT  sensors over metal oxides [ 295 ]  However, these CNT transistors  also demonstrated nonspeciﬁ  c sensitivity for NO 2 , as well as  slow response and recovery times unless UV irradiation was  used to accelerate regeneration Another ﬂ exible CNT transistor  was demonstrated for the detection of CO to 1 ppm [ 296 ]  By  using two transistors fabricated from CNTs containing varying  levels of defects, it was possible to discriminate the detection of  CO from NO/NO 2      412     Liquid Phase Detection with CNT-Based Sensors    Transistors:  CNT transistors on ﬂ  exible substrates have been  demonstrated for a number of small molecules and ions,     Figure 10    Selective H 2  sensing via PdNP-decorated CNT chemiresistors a) Schematic of ﬂ exible CNT device on a PET substrate CVD grown CNTs  are transferred to PET using dry transfer technique, followed by PdNP electrodeposition b) Image highlighting extreme ﬂ exibility of fabricated devices  Adapted with permission [ 294a ]  c) Bending fatigue and effect of bending on sensing Device shows little change in sensitivity on being bent to a radius  of curvature of 75 mm Adapted with permission [ 294b ]  Copyright 2007, American Institute of Physics  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6014 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde achieved to 20 ppm using a novel ﬂ  exible 3D graphene foam  architecture [ 314 ]  Alcohol detection has been demonstrated  using a hybrid graphene/ZnO sensor, with a demonstrated  detection limit of 10 ppm for EtOH [ 315 ]    In general, gas phase detection with graphene chemiresis- tors is nonspeciﬁ c, and cross-reactivity is common In order to  be used for e-skin applications, improved selective sensing will  be necessary and can potentially be achieved through the use of  chemiselective polymers or deposition of NPs Chung et al dec- orated graphene chemiresistors with PdNPs to enhance selec- tivity for H 2  [ 316 ]  They reported a detection limit of 20 ppm,  which is comparable to that reported on inﬂ  exible graphene  sensors (40 ppm) [ 308e ]  In general, operation of these sensors  occurs in either inert or vacuum atmospheres, as graphene is  inherently sensitive to O 2  and other gaseous analytes present  in the atmosphere [ 76,314 ]  Furthermore, sensors decorated with  PdNPs operate with reduced sensitivity in an oxygenated envi- ronment owing to the deactivation of the PdNPs [ 316 ]  Despite  these drawbacks, a number of ﬂ exible graphene chemiresistors  have nonetheless been demonstrated to operate in air, [ 313 ]  thus  paving the way towards the development of sensors for prac- tical e-skin applications   The response time for detection of gaseous analytes with  ﬂ exible graphene chemiresistors is rapid, although it is highly  dependent on analyte concentration [ 316 ]  In addition, gra- phene chemiresistors typically experience slow recovery times  (≈several mins) owing to the strong association between the  gaseous analytes and the defects on the graphene surface While  some studies have reported the use of UV irradiation [ 76 ]  or ele- vated temperatures [ 290b,314 ]  to assist sensor regeneration, these  treatments would require the integration of additional com- ponents (such as microheaters and UV lamps) into the e-skin  architecture

 Regeneration could also be accelerated through  the use of transistors rather than chemiresistors, which have  been demonstrated to facilitate analyte desorption by applying  a reverse bias; however, to the best of our knowledge, no tran- sistor based ﬂ exible sensors have yet been reported   The effect of device bending on analyte sensing is a critical  consideration for e-skin applications Ideally, the performance  of the device should remain unaffected under either compres- sion or tension; however, a number of reports indicated have  minor changes (<5%) in sensitivity during bending [ 290b,313,316 ]   The long-term operational stability of these sensors is also  important for e-skin applications so that they do not require  frequent replacement, though few reports discuss this impor- tant factor Jeong et al reported little change in the measured  resistance over a 6-month period for their hybrid CNT /rGO  sensors, [ 290b ]  which is encouraging for their integration into  e-skin     422     Liquid Phase Detection with Graphene-Based Sensors    Chemiresistors : McApline and coworkers recently reported a  resistive graphene sensor that was printed on a bio-resorbable  silk substrate They demonstrated that the sensor could be  mounted on complex surfaces (such as tooth enamel, muscle  tissue, and plastic packaging) by dissolving the silk substrate  ( Figure    11 ) [ 317 ]  Functionalization of the graphene surface with  CNT /PEDOT electrode that was capable of glucose detection to  01 m M  (linear range of 1 to 10 m M ) and of measuring glucose  levels in human serum [ 302 ]    For e-skin applications, high stability over time is necessary,  and therefore enzyme-based electrochemical sensors may not  be suitable for e-skin applications owing to restrictions on their  storage conditions and limited lifetimes resulting from the use  of enzymes Rapid degradation of these “enzyme electrodes”  would be an important issue requiring resolution before such  sensors could be employed in e-skin For example, Yan et al  reported a 20% decrease in activity in week, despite storage  at 4 °C [ 301b ]  By replacing the biomolecular recognition ele- ment (GO x ) with electrocatalytically deposited PdNPs to form  a non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor, Pham et al were able  to improve the device stability without sacriﬁ cing sensitivity  (detection limit of 0003 m M ) [ 303 ]  Additionally, Bui et al dem- onstrated the direct detection of H 2 O 2  to 276  μ  M  (linear range  002 to 18 m M ) using ﬂ exible, enzyme-free CNT electrodes  decorated with catalytic AgNPs [ 304 ]  They found that the sen- sors were relatively stable for long-term continuous operation  and retained 90% of their original activity after 30 days without  special storage conditions This type of enzyme-free electrode  would be more practical for e-skin applications, despite its  intrinsically lower speciﬁ city for a particular analyte      42     Graphene-Based Sensors   Like CNTs, graphene has exceptional electrical transport prop- erties As a planar sheet of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms, gra- phene exhibits the highest possible surface-to-volume ratio, [ 305 ]   and a larger detection area than CNTs [ 283a ]  Since each atom  can potentially contribute to the sensing response, graphene’s  electrical conductivity is incredibly sensitive to adsorption of  chemical species on its surface [ 306 ]  This sensitivity, in combi- nation with graphene’s extremely low intrinsic noise, allows  such sensors to be capable of a wide sensitivity range, from  the single-molecule level to high concentrations [ 75,306,307 ]  The  extremely sensitive detection of a large number of analytes  has been demonstrated with inﬂ exible graphene sensors in  both gaseous [ 75,306–308 ]  and liquid [ 70,309 ]  phases Most early gra- phene sensors were chemiresistors, [ 306,307,310 ]  but FET-based  sensors for gaseous detection have also been developed [ 311 ]   The two primary types of liquid-phase graphene sensors are  transistors [ 309e–g ]  and electrodes [ 312 ]  We review both gas- and  liquid-phase ﬂ exible graphene sensors below    421     Gas Phase Detection with Chemiresistive Graphene-Based  Sensors   The ﬁ eld of ﬂ exible graphene sensors is still relatively young,  with only a small number of ﬂ  exible graphene chemiresistors  existing for the detection of toxic gases Due to its strong elec- tron donating ability, NO 2  is one of the most prevalent analytes  detected [ 76,313 ]  Additionally, it is of interest as a decomposi- tion product for certain explosives NO 2  detection has been  demonstrated to 500 ppb with graphene as the sole sensing  element [ 76 ]  NH 3  detection, which may also be of importance  for the detection of ammonium nitrate explosives, has been  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025]

, and demon- strated only a 5% resistance increase after 196 h (or 500 cycles)  of bending for their AuNP decorated sensors, [ 327c ]  and a 5%  increase in resistance after 24 h (or 100 cycles) for their PtNP  decorated sensors [ 327b ]  Other groups noted a 10% decrease after  100 bending cycles [ 327a,329 ]  However, Labroo et al observed an  84% decrease in sensitivity with a single 180 ° bend, and 90%  decrease after 10 successive bending cycles [ 328 ]  The difference  in performance could result from their use of their use of CVD- grown graphene rather than rGO graphene, but the cause of  this variability should be further investigated Overall, ﬂ exible  graphene sensors show much potential for e-skin applications      43     Organic-Material-Based Sensors   Organic materials, OSs and CPs, are attractive sensing mate- rials owing to their compatibility with large-area, low-temper- ature solution processing techniques that allow for deposition  onto ﬂ exible substrates, as well as the reduced material and  fabrication costs compared to CNTs and graphene These mate- rials offer the advantage of synthetic versatility, which can be  used to enhance not only sensitivity and selectivity for par- ticular species but also the stability of the active material [ 90b ]   Furthermore, variation of the deposition conditions can be used  to alter the morphology, which inﬂ uences the sensing capability  of the devices [ 91,331 ]  The role of grain boundaries on sensing  has been investigated by a number of groups [ 332 ]  who deter- mined that the sensing response is correlated with the number  of grain boundaries present in the ﬁ lm [ 90b ]  Another example of  the interplay between morphology and sensitivity is the ability  to deposit CPs as thin ﬁ lms or as NWs Because the NWs have  higher surface area, they demonstrate increased sensitivity [ 333 ]   OSs and CPs have already demonstrated tremendous potential  for both e-nose [ 284b,334 ]  and e-tongue [ 335,336 ]  applications   For e-skin, the ability of sensors to operate in both ambient  and liquid environments for real-time detection applications  is critical However, OSs may require large operating voltages,  which is incompatible with liquid-phase operation The dielec- tric layer can be manipulated in order to limit operating volt- ages, either through the use of ultrathin [ 335 ]  or high- k  dielec- trics Additionally, many early OSs were inherently unstable  on exposure to water vapor [ 337 ]  To address this issue, Someya  et al used electrode encapsulation to operate a pentacene tran- sistor in contact with water [ 338 ]  Our group has also used the  synthetic versatility of organic materials to develop an inher- ently water-stable OS, 5,5′-bis-(7-dodecyl- 9H -ﬂ uoren-2-yl)-2–2′- biothiophene (DDFTTF), which was used to fabricate transis- tors demonstrating stable, long-term operation underwater [ 335 ]    For sensing applications, OS and CPs can be fabricated into  electrodes, chemiresistors, and transistors Much emphasis has  been placed on transistor-based detection, as it has been dem- onstrated to have superior sensitivity to chemiresistors [ 281 ]  In  addition, multiparameter measurements can be achieved with  transistors, allowing for simultaneous measurement of changes  in conductivity, threshold voltage ( V  T ), and   μ   [ 339 ]  It is also pos- sible to expedite recovery time by desorbing weakly bound  analytes by applying a reverse bias to the transistor, [ 281b,332a,334c ]   Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6017wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde functionalization strategy is particularly ﬂ  exible owing to the  vast library of existing thiolated receptor groups that are com- patible with this sensing platform Our group has used this  platform to selectively detect Hg 2+  to 1  μ  M  with selectivity over  ten other interferent ions by functionalizing the AuNPs with  a thiolated DNA aptamer for Hg 2+  (Figure   12 b) [ 336c ]  The ﬂ ex- ibility of this platform was highlighted by the interchangeability  of the receptor groups; substitution of a different thiolated  DNA aptamer allowed for the detection of thrombin, a model  protein, to 100 p M  (Figure   12 c) [ 336b ]  In addition, the composi- tion of these NPs can be varied to include other functional spe- cies, [ 347 ]  further increasing the number of receptor groups that  can be used with this sensing platform      432

     Gas Phase Detection with Organic Material-Based Sensors    Chemiresistors  : For gas-phase detection, a number of ﬂ  exible  organic chemiresistors have been developed for the nonspe- ciﬁ c detection of a variety of analytes, including strong oxi- dants, [ 348 ]  NH 3 , [ 349 ]  H 2 O, [ 350 ]  H 2 , [ 351 ]  and O 2  [ 352 ]  Jang et al  demonstrated the selective detection of NH 3  over other com- pounds due to its unique ability to convert PANI between  its emeraldine salt and base forms [ 353 ]  Several techniques  were used to enhance the sensitivity of these ﬂ  exible organic  chemiresistors The use of PANI NPs [ 353 ]  and PANI NWs [ 354 ]   signiﬁ cantly enhanced detection for NH 3 , as compared to a  similar device made from a thin-ﬁ  lm of PANI [ 355 ]  Addition- ally, the use of CNT /organic hybrid materials was reported to  increase sensitivity [ 356 ]    The response and regeneration of these ﬂ  exible organic  chemiresistor sensors was typically slow ( ≈several mins),  which is impractical for real-time e-skin sensing applications  However, recovery time could be improved through the use of  thinner ﬁ lms or UV-treatments [ 348b ]  Interestingly, while early  reports suggested exposure to strong oxidants (such as NO 2 ,  SO 2 , and Cl 2 ) resulted in the irreversible chemisorption of the  oxidants along the polymer backbone, Dua et al were able to  reverse the response by exposing their PT nanoﬁ bers to UV  light [ 348a ]  However, they noted that damage induced by UV  irradiation could potentially limit the number of regeneration  cycles that could be achieved with a single device and ultimately  limit the lifetime of their sensors   The issue of long-term sensor stability is critical for imple- mentation in e-skin Crowley et al found that though their  sensors could be regenerated initially, sensitivity declined over  time [ 351 ]  They further noted that the use of high temperatures  degraded their sensors and therefore could not be used as a  means of sensor regeneration Rizzo et al reported sensors that  were stable over months of operation [ 355 ]  Su et al found little  variation in sensing performance after 43 days, suggesting long- term potential for these organic sensors [ 350b ]  Stable performance  under ambient conditions is also critical for e-skin applications  While several groups have reported that operation in air is pos- sible, [ 349,355 ]  Dua et al reported that the sensitivity of their sensors  decreased in air, [ 348a ]  and others have only demonstrated the oper- ation of their sensors in inert or vacuum environments [ 353,354,356 ]   Since the operation of such sensors in controlled environments  is not practical for e-skin applications, attention should be given  to developing air-stable sensors with high sensitivity  which can preclude the need for harsher treatments (eg, high  temperatures, UV, ozone) and is therefore advantageous for  e-skin applications Organic transistors can be subdivided  into organic ﬁ eld-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic elec- trochemical transistors (OECTs) [ 90c ]  OECTs are unique in that  they can conduct ions in addition to holes and electrons [ 284c ]     431     Functionalization Techniques for Selective Sensing   OSs and CPs are inherently sensitive to a number of analytes,  and Crone et al have mapped the response of an array of eleven  OSs exposed to sixteen volatile organic compounds in order to  determine a sensing “ﬁ ngerprint” [ 334a ]  Liao et al also devel- oped an early e-nose based on the ﬁ  ngerprinting technique [ 340 ]   The sensitivity of these early sensors allowed for detection to  the part-per-million (ppm) level, [ 88 ]  but they lacked speciﬁ  city,  which is critical for e-skin applications since it is impractical to  precisely regulate the operating atmosphere   To achieve more targeted and sensitive detection, the incor- poration of receptor groups is required One advantage of OS  and CPs is the ability to enhance their selectivity through chem- ical structure manipulation [ 90c ]  For example, Torsi et al dem- onstrated enhanced sensitivity for compounds with a dipole  moment by using alkoxy groups instead of alkyl groups in the  side chains of an OS [ 341 ]  Torsi et al have also incorporated  chiral groups to allow for enantiomeric selectivity [ 342 ]  How- ever, manipulation of the chemical structure may introduce  trap states or alter the packing morphology of the semicon- ductor, which detracts from the electronic performance of the  device [ 90a ]  Several groups have proposed the use of OS bilayers  to circumvent this issue In this approach, an electronically  optimized OS is ﬁ rst deposited to form the channel, followed  by the subsequent deposition of an OS that has been chemi- cally modiﬁ ed to incorporate recognition elements [ 342,343 ]  The  deposition of electrical insulators on top of pristine OS has also  been used to provide functionalization sites for future covalent  modiﬁ cation

 Knoll, Bao, and coworkers grafted peptide nucleic  acid residues onto a thin poly(maleic anhydride) layer deposited  onto a DDFTTF OFET to demonstrate the detection of DNA  with single-base pair discrimination [ 344 ]  Torsi and coworkers  have also pioneered the use of a functional biointerlayers to  enhance detection selectivity [ 345 ]  In this unique approach, the  biological receptor molecules were deposited directly onto the  dielectric layer, and physically separated from their analytes by  the OS layer   Other non-covalent functionalization techniques exist that  allow for the incorporation of individual binding sites without  interfering with the chemical structure of the OS Our group  has used thermally evaporated calix[n]arene groups to increase  detection speciﬁ city in OFETs [ 346 ]  These calix[n]arene receptors  could be tuned via chemical synthesis to impart speciﬁ  city for  particular volatile organic species, such as ethyl acetate and iso- propyl alcohol We recently demonstrated that ordered arrays of  AuNPs deposited onto OFETs can provide grafting sites for the  integration of thiolated receptor groups ( Figure    12 a) [ 336b,336c   ]   By taking advantage of the self-assembly properties of a  poly(styrene- b -vinylpyridine) (PS- b -PVP) polymer, we used a  simple, low-temperature spin-casting technique to deposit  ordered arrays of AuNPs onto a water-stable OFET This  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6018 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde found to change during bending, and deﬁ  ned a mobility factor  ( F  M ) parameter to describe the relationship between strain and  OS performance This  F  M  was found to be generally positive for  pentacene, but generally negative for DHFTTF Furthermore,  the composition of the dielectric was found to play a crucial role  on  F  M  for each OS Importantly, we found that modiﬁ cation of  the dielectric with a dense self-assembled monolayer of octade- cylsilane (OTS) could signiﬁ cantly decrease  F  M  for both pen- tacene and DHFTTF, thus diminishing the effect of bending  strain on device performance and therefore sensing      433     Liquid Phase Detection with Organic Material-Based Sensors    Transistors : A number of ﬂ exible OFETs [ 359 ]  have been developed  for the detection of various small molecule analytes including  explosives, [ 359b ]  cysteine, [ 359b ]  biotin, [ 359a ]  and sodium dodecyl  sulfate (SDS) [ 359a ]  Lin et al also demonstrated DNA detection  using a ﬂ exible PEDOT:PSS OECT [ 360 ]  They reported a detec- tion limit of 1 n M  for the complementary DNA sequence and  were able to further increase their sensitivity to 10 p M  using  pulse gating Interestingly, they reported that the device char- acteristics did not change signiﬁ cantly on bending and that  the sensors were stable to measurement over a several-day  period These qualities are essential for e-skin applications For  all of the ﬂ exible transistors that were reported, response and    Transistors : Even though many gas-phase transistor sensors  on rigid substrates have been reported, only a single report  exists for ﬂ exible transistors: namely, a PEDOT:PSS OECT for  relative humidity (RH) detection [ 357 ]  This sensor was fabricated  on both polyester and paper substrates using solution deposition  techniques and was demonstrated to have a rapid response to  25–80% RH The sensor showed tremendous promise for long- term sensing applications, as it could be stored for 6 months  under ambient conditions with only a minimal (7%) decrease  in sensitivity Additionally, the OECT retained its performance  after being bent to a radius of curvature of 5 cm, but the effect  of bending on sensing was not thoroughly investigated   The ability of e-skin to permit movement requires its constit- uent materials be capable of bending and stretching However,  despite the critical role that bending plays in e-skin applications,  its effect on chemical and biological sensor performance has  received relatively little attention Our group recently studied  the effect of ﬂ exing on OFET performance in order to shed  more light on this critical parameter for e-skin applications [ 358 ]   We examined the response of two OSs (pentacene and 5,5 ′-bis- (7-hexyl- 9H -ﬂ uoresn-2-yl)-2,2′-bithiophene (DHFTTF)), and  several polymer dielectrics to strain induced by ﬂ  exing during  operation We found that both the active material and the die- lectric can inﬂ uence the device’s response to compressive and  tensile strains ( Figure    13 ) Importantly, we observed that   μ   was     Figure 12

however, there are contra- dictory reports on the biocompatibility of many of the active  materials used in e-skin fabrication For example, CNTs have  been found to show asbestos-like pathogenic behavior due to  their small size and needle-like morphology, [ 365 ]  and have been  reported as highly toxic to cells at high concentrations [ 366 ]  Other  reports suggested that the immunogenic response elicited by  CNTs incorporated into electronic devices was dependent on  nanotopology For example, Agarwal et al compared cell growth  on CNT networks and rGO surfaces, and found that morpho- logical differences were the primary factors differentiating their  biocompatibility [ 367 ]  In particular, the atomically ﬂ  at rGO was  found to be biocompatible with various mammalian cell lines,  regeneration occurred rapidly ( ∼ secs), allowing for real-time  detection in situ   Organic active materials that are inherently unstable in  water can be encapsulated to prevent their direct contact with  aqueous solutions A number of ion-sensitive OFETs (ISOFETs)  have been developed for pH detection [ 361 ]  that use pentacene as  the active material and a chemiselective Ta 2 O 5  dielectric as the  encapsulation layer Knoll, Bao and coworkers used a different  encapsulation strategy; they deposited a layer of copper pth- alocynanine (CuPC) onto a pentacene OFET

 [ 359a ]  Although the  performance of these ﬂ exible OFETs was slightly reduced com- pared to similar devices fabricated on rigid substrates, [ 336a ]  they  were still able to demonstrate the sensitive detection of biotin  to 200 n M  and SDS to 1  μ  M  [ 359a ]  Alternatively, we reported the  use of an inherently water stable OS (DDFTTF) to fabricate  a ﬂ exible OFET sensor [ 359b ]  The   μ   of these sensors was simi- larly depressed from that demonstrated on rigid substrates,  but they were capable of the highly sensitive detection of both  trinitrobenzene (TNB) and cysteine to the sub-ppm level An  interesting feature of the liquid-phase OFETs developed by our  group is that they did not require a solution gate, unlike most  CNT and graphene transistors that have been reviewed here  Until liquid gates can be effectively miniaturized, the use of a  solid-state back gate instead of a liquid gate is critical for suc- cessful incorporation into e-skin     Figure 13    Effect of bending on OFET performance a) Schematic repre- sentation of semiconductors and dielectric materials used in study Inset  shows device response versus time response of a device under tensile  and compressive strain b) Graphical comparison of mobility factors ( F  M )  for devices with pentacene (ﬁ  lled marker) and DHFTTF (open marker)  semiconductors on each of the seven dielectrics tested Reproduced with  permission [ 358 ]   Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6020 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde rally occurring byproducts of other cellular processes, so their  decomposition would not elicit a cytotoxic response Similarly,  Rogers and coworkers have shown that ultrathin Si devices fab- ricated on silk substrates with magnesium (Mg) interconnects  and a MgO dielectric were rapidly dissolved in water over a  period of 10 min (Figure   14 b) [ 378 ]  While these materials were  not not naturally occurring, each material was reported to be  individually biocompatible Furthermore, by encapsulating  the devices in crystallized silk, a two-stage transience could  be achieved, allowing for a programmed rate of degradation  Another route to tuning the degradation rate of devices is by  adjusting the chemical structure of the constituent organic  molecules For example, Zelkin et al demonstrated that biode- gradable PPY derivatives could be fabricated through the incor- poration of ionizable and hydrolysable side groups [ 379 ]     Resorbable substrates can also play a key role in interfacing  e-skins with the body Rogers and coworkers fabricated devices  for electrocorticography [ 380 ]  and cardiac electrophysiology [ 381 ]   measurements on mechanically compliant substrates The con- formability of these devices was further improved by using bio- resorbable silk substrates to deposit them on the surface of the  brain [ 382 ]  or implant them within the brain [ 383 ]  Overall, much  progress has been made toward developing biocompatible and  biodegradable devices, allowing for the possibility of integrating  e-skins with the human body     52     Self-Healing   While naturally occurring human skin has the ability to repair  itself after incurring mechanical damage, this property has yet  to be fully realized in e-skin For artiﬁ cial skin, the ability to  repair both mechanical and electrical damage would be highly  advantageous for practical applications There are two predomi- nant strategies used to incorporate self-healing properties into  materials, namely: 1) the use of materials loaded with healing  agents, [ 384 ]  and 2) the use of materials containing dynamic  reversible bonds [ 385 ]  The incorporation of capsules containing  healants was ﬁ rst demonstrated in self-healing, non-conducting  polymers [ 384a ]  However, for e-skin applications, it is necessary  to use a system that is electrically active To this end, Odom et al  have separately incorporated the charge transfer salts tetrathi- afulvanene (TTF) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)  into poly(urea-formaldehyde) core-shell microcapsules [ 386 ]  On  fracture, the TTF and TCNQ components will mix to form a  charge transfer salt that restores the electrical conductivity  to the composite material However, this approach requires  adequate mixing of the individually packaged TTF and TCNQ  components In order to overcome this requirement, White,  Moore, and coworkers have pursued the incorporation of liquid  metal healant capsules into conductive circuits

 [ 384b,384c   ]  Speciﬁ - cally, the use of eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) [ 384b ]  and Ag  ink [ 384c ]  healants allowed for rapid self-healing without the need  for further mixing after the capsules have been mechanically  ruptured While this strategy allows for almost instantaneous  (160  μ s) return of the electrical conductivity, [ 384b ]  the disad- vantage of the healant capsule approach is that it is a single  occurrence event: that is, the material no longer possesses self- healing properties after the ﬁ rst use  whereas the CNT surface impeded cell proliferation Addition- ally, we have recently explored the effect of CNT morphology on  cell cytotoxicity in vitro by comparing drop cast and spun cast  CNT samples [ 368 ]  We found that the increased roughness of the  drop cast surfaces resulted in higher cytotoxicity as compared  to the 2D morphology of the aligned, spun cast CNTs In addi- tion to morphology, other studies have suggested that concen- tration may inﬂ uence biocompatibility; Wang et al determined  that both in vitro and in vivo, low concentrations of rGO did not  elicit a toxic response, but higher doses had clear indications of  cytotoxicity [ 369 ]    The biocompatibility of organic materials is also highly vari- able, and factors such as chemical composition, surface charge,  and pH are responsible for inﬂ uencing cytotoxicity For CPs,  additional factors such as monomer, solvent, and/or dopant  leaching also inﬂ uence biocompatibility [ 370 ]  Despite the large  number of factors governing biocompatibility, some materials,  such as PPY and PEDOT derivatives, have generally been found  to be biocompatible For example, PEDOT:p-toluenesolfunate  (PEDOT:TOS) OECTs have been used to control cell density gra- dients, [ 371 ]  while PEDOT:PSS OECTs have been used to monitor  in vitro cell activities [ 372 ]  Overall, these ﬁ ndings suggest there is  a need to control the morphology of the active material, while  limiting its concentration within devices in order to improve  biocompatibility More importantly, ensuring that these active  materials do not leach from the electronic devices is critical for  their implementation in e-skin   Other strategies exist to improve the biocompatibility of the  active materials used in e-skin Immobilization of cell-adhesion  peptides, polysaccharides, and growth factors, either through  physical entrapment or covalent attachment, have been demon- strated to inﬂ uence biocompatibility [ 370a ]  The use of naturally  occurring materials is another approach to increase biocompat- ibility A number of naturally occurring materials, such as cara- melized glucose, hard gelatin, and starches, have already been  demonstrated as substrates for electronic devices [ 373 ]  Further- more, molecules such as DNA [ 374 ]  and sugars have also been  used as dielectric materials, and naturally occurring OS such  as indigo [ 375 ]  and its derivatives and carotenoid polyenes have  been used as active materials [ 373 ]  Additionally, motivated by the  stable hydrogen-bonded  π –stacked structure of natural dyes,  hydrogen-bonded analogues of linear acenes have recently been  demonstrated as OS as well [ 376 ]  While the electronic perfor- mance of these devices will require considerable optimization  to be useful for e-skin applications, they demonstrate a prom- ising route to biocompatibility   The concept of transient electronics, which dissolve or resorb  into the body at a programmed rate, is an additional ben- eﬁ t offered by devices synthesized from natural compounds  We recently reported the development of a resorbable OFET  fabricated from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers  ( Figure    14 a) [ 377 ]  The device was fabricated on a poly(l-lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA) substrate, utilizing a poly(vinyl alcohol)  (PVA) dielectric, DDFTTF active layer, and Au contacts The  PLGA substrate accounted for 9989% of the device’s total  mass and disintegrated completed over a period of 70 days in  citrate buffer, indicating the feasibility of biodegradable elec- tronics for e-skin applications Moreover, the degradation prod- ucts released through the breakdown of the OFET were natu- Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6021wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde the composite; an analogous composite made with smooth  μ Ni  particles had low conductivity (10 −6  S cm −1 )

 Furthermore, by  maintaining the volume loading of the  μ Ni particles just below  the percolation threshold (15% vol loading), the composite  material was made to be responsive to external forces, such as  ﬂ exion (Figure   15 c) and tactile pressure (Figure   15 d) The com- pressive stress from ﬂ exion and/or pressure imparted from tac- tile stimuli brought the  μ Ni particles into closer proximity, pro- ducing the sensing response These results are quite promising  toward the development of intrinsic, fully self-healing materials  for e-skin applications However, additional work to improve the  stability and sensitivity of these materials is needed      53     Temperature Sensitivity   Sensing temperature is a key functionality of human skin that  helps to prevent injury and provides information about the  surrounding environment As previously mentioned in Section  3, most tactile sensors are inherently temperature sensitive,  and their response must therefore be calibrated with a tempera- ture sensor [ 263 ]  Several groups have implemented piezoelectric/ pyroelectric sensors that can discriminate between tempera- ture and pressure inputs Graz et al used novel bifunctional  composites, [ 279 ]  while Trung et al used a novel AC biasing  method [ 278 ]  Resistive temperature detectors (RTD) are attractive  for e-skin applications owing to their ﬂ  exibility, simple device  structure, and compatibility with electronic readout methods   To address this consideration, the use of reversible dynamic bonds  for multi-use self-healing applications has been investigated  Williams et al have introduced reversible crosslinking groups  into CP networks;  [ 387 ]  however, the demonstrated conductivity  of their material (10 −3  S cm −1 ) was insufﬁ cient for use in e-skins  To increase conductivity, it is possible to use the conductive ﬁ ller  approach: that is, seeding insulating polymers with inorganic  conducting materials For example, Li et al have incorporated  AgNWs into a blended polymer membrane of branched poly- ethyleneamine and poly(acrylic acid)–hylauronic acid (bPEI/ PAA-HA) [ 388 ]  The structural and electrical integrity of the ﬁ  lm  was maintained thanks to reversible ionic bonds between the  positively charged carboxylic acid groups decorating the bPEI/ PAA-HA and pyrrolidone groups coating the AgNWs [ 388 ]  How- ever, the self-healing properties were dependent on exposure of  the membrane to water For e-skin applications, it is preferable  to have materials that self-heal without the need for external  stimulants (such as light, heat, solvents, water)   We recently demonstrated the ﬁ rst intrinsically self-healing  conductive composite material ( Figure    15 ) [ 19 ]  A composite mate- rial, formed with nickel microparticles ( μ Ni particles) embedded  in a hydrogen-bonded polymer matrix, was highly conductive  (40 S cm −1  at concentrations above the percolation threshold  of  μ Ni particles) Furthermore, this material was intrinsically  self-healing and regained 90% of its conductivity within 15 s of  incurring mechanical damage at room temperature and without  any external stimuli (Figures   15 a,b) The unique nanostruc- turing of the  μ Ni particles facilitated the self-healing property of     Figure 14    Transient electronics fabricated from bio-resorbable materials a) Degradation of an OFET sensor with DDFTTF semiconductor and  PVA  dielectric on a PLGA substrate over a 70-day period Adapted with permission [ 377 ]  b) Degradation of a Si-based device with Mg interconnects and a  MgO dielectric on a silk substrate over a 10-min period Adapted with permission [ 378 ]  Copyright 2012, AAAS  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6022 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde temperature region can be many orders of magnitude In com- posites of a single polymer and ﬁ  ller, the change in resistance  has little reproducibility [ 394a,395 ]  because the material’s mor- phology can change during the melting and freezing processes  Composites comprised of multiple ﬁ llers and/or multiple  polymers have shown improved reproducibility [ 396 ]  Our group  has demonstrated a wireless temperature sensor composed of  polyethylene (PE), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and  μ Ni particles  that possessed excellent sensing characteristics within tunable  temperature ranges ( Figure    16 ) [ 392 ]  The PE and PEO formed  interpenetrating networks with the  μ Ni particles segregated  into the PEO domains Large changes in resistance occurred at  the melting point of PEO, which could be tuned by varying its  molecular weight

 [ 20b ]  The adopted  active matrix technology has subsequently been used to drive a  range of devices, including pressure sensors, temperature sen- sors, electromagnetic interference sensors, [ 418 ]  and actuators for  tactile feedback arrays [ 419 ]  By integrating a ﬂ oating gate into their  OFETs, pixels with memory capabilities were created that could  locally store information from piezoresistive elements [ 15c ]  For  device readout, local memory is important to capture transient  events that may be shorter than the readout time of the sensor  array and to provide a “snapshot” of an instantaneous distribu- tion of the stimulus [ 166b ]  The work of Someya and coworkers has  been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [ 136d,273 ]     Javey and coworkers have also developed high-throughput  fabrication methods for e-skin applications as well [ 420 ]  They  have produced active matrix arrays of pressure sensors using  inorganic NWs and CNTs as the semiconductor The use of  on either side of a soft PDMS membrane, and strain sensing  was accomplished using piezoresistive Si strain gauges with geo- metrically tunable responses Electrotactile information could be  communicated via electrodes situated inside the ﬁ nger tube   Using thin, breathable substrate materials, Rogers and cow- orkers developed an EES that could be transferred onto the  skin in a manner akin to a temporary tattoo (Figure   19 b) [ 390a ]   This system could stretch reversibly to 30% without damage  or delamination, which is sufﬁ cient to accommodate natural  movements Temperature, strain, and electrical measurement  capabilities were demonstrated, as well as active and passive  components for signal readout Solar cells and wireless devices  were later integrated for self-powered applications, [ 390a ]  and  both the mechanics and capabilities of the device were charac- terized in a subsequent report [ 417 ]    Using transistors with highly compressible dielectrics, our  group has made ﬂ exible pressure sensors for healthcare moni- toring The devices were operated in the subthreshold regime,  resulting in low power consumption and exceptionally high  sensitivity (84 kPa −1 ) [ 3 ]  The devices were patterned into an  array that could detect the pressure distribution created by a  46 mg weight Patterning the dielectric avoided the bulk vis- coelasticity of the elastomer and provided a response time of  ≈10 ms, which was fast enough to measure arterial pulse shape  with good resolution and could be used to assess a patient’s car- diovascular health (Figures   19 c,d) Furthermore, these solution- processed devices provide a more economical alternative to  conventional Si MEMS technology [ 153 ]      62     E-Skin for Robotics   Compliant devices with integrated tactile functionality could  be used as skin-like sensors for intelligent robots One of the     Figure 19    Highly integrated e-skins for biomedical applications a) Optical image of a multifunctional balloon catheter with temperature  sensors,  microscale LEDs, and tactile sensors in deﬂ  ated (upper) and inﬂ ated (lower) states Adapted with permission [ 390b ]  Copyright 2011, Macmillan Pub- lishers Ltd b) Optical images of multifunctional EES on unstretched (left) and stretched (right) skin Adapted with permission  [ 390a ]  Copyright 2011,  AAAS c) Flexible pressure transistor sensor capable of d) arterial pulse shape measurement Adapted with permission [ 3 ]  Copyright 2013, Macmillan  Publishers Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6026 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde Additionally, Rogers and coworkers have demonstrated stretch- able and twistable GaAs-based arrays of micro-LEDs ( μ -ILEDs)  and micro-photodetectors ( μ -IPDs) (Figures   20 c) and integrated  them into gloves [ 20c ]  These devices were fabricated by transfer  printing arrays of devices onto elastomeric substrates and con- necting them with stretchable interconnects The  μ -ILEDs and   μ -IPDs could be used to monitor the proximity of objects based  on the detection of backscattered light Javey and coworkers  very recently described a user-interactive e-skin capable of spa- tially mapping pressure stimuli through integrated OLEDs [ 424 ]   Someya and coworkers have also fabricated stretchable arrays of  OLEDs using ﬂ exible OLED islands connected with stretchable  printed conductors [ 20b ]       7     Conclusions and Outlook   In the past decade, the pace of e-skin development has accel- erated dramatically owing to the availability of new materials  and processes

 As a result of this progress, the capabilities of  e-skin are rapidly converging on those depicted in science ﬁ c- tion (Figure   1 ) Interest in e-skin has been driven by its poten- tial to: 1) enable highly the development of interactive and  versatile robots that are capable of performing complex tasks in  less structured environments; 2) facilitate conformable displays  and optics; and 3) revolutionize healthcare by providing biomi- metic prostheses, constant health monitoring technologies, and  unprecedented diagnostic and treatment proﬁ ciency Sensors  and circuits have already exceeded the properties of biological  skin in many respects Electronic devices have been fabricated  that stretch many times further than skin, [ 137 ]  ﬂ exible tactile  sensors have been demonstrated that possess vastly superior  these semiconductors provides   μ   ≈ 20 cm 2  V −1  s −1 , [ 23a,136b ]  which  is signiﬁ cantly greater than typical high-performance organic  devices These high-performance devices are beneﬁ  cial for  allowing high-speed sensor readout Stretchable tactile arrays  were created by patterning the ﬂ exible substrate into a porous  honeycomb shape [ 136b ]  This combination of high-throughput  printing techniques and high performance is well suited for  e-skin applications   Recently, Wu et al reported high-density arrays of tactile sen- sors using vertically aligned and individually addressed ZnO  NWs (Figure   20 b) [ 23b ]  Under strain, the piezoelectric effect in  the NWs modiﬁ ed the charge injection barrier and the current  through the device The use of piezoelectric charge as a gate  signal eliminated the need for a gate electrode, creating a two  terminal devices that could be multiplexed with high density  (8,464 cm −2 ), which is approximately 35 times higher than that  of human skin The devices were observed to amply respond to  applied pressures up to 30 kPa     63     E-Skin for Optoelectronics   Stretchable optoelectronics for applications such as stretch- able or semitransparent displays, biomedical imaging, [ 152 ]  and  hemispherical photodetector (PD) arrays are promising [ 421 ]   Traditional planar PD arrays require complicated optics and/or  image correction software to extract an accurate image Curved  PDs similar to the human retina have been developed that can  simplify the required optics, reducing the cost and weight of the  detector [ 198a,421 ]  Furthermore, detectors with adjustable forms  can provide dynamically tunable zoom and focusing, [ 422 ]  and  can mimic the sophisticated imaging system of insect eyes [ 423 ]      Figure 20    Highly integrated e-skins for robotics and optoelectronic applications a) Stretchable active matrix devices reported by the S omeya group  including biaxial stretching of an integrated, encapsulated device demonstrating a conformal coverage of a non-planar surface ( left), and a depiction  of an individual organic transistor in the array (right) Adapted with permission [ 15b ]  Copyright 2008, AAAS b) Depiction of piezoelectric NWs used as  an array of active tactile sensors with unprecedented spatial density Adapted with permission [ 23b ]  Copyright 2013, AAAS c) Stretchable and twistable  LED arrays Adapted with permission [ 20c ]  Copyright 2010, Macmillan Publishers Ltd  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6027wileyonlinelibrarycom© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde to cross-reactivity with species present under ambient condi- tions (such as O 2  and H 2 O) A handful of techniques have been  developed to increase speciﬁ  city for particular analytes, the  most promising of which are the use of chemiselective ﬁ  lms  and the deposition of catalytic NPs The ability to quickly regen- erate these sensors is also important for e-skin applications,  but unfortunately, most chemiresistors are plagued by lengthy  recovery times To implement this technology in e-skins, it may  be necessary to incorporate a microheater or UV light source  in order to accelerate regeneration times, which adds additional  complexity to the device Recovery times could also poten- tially be accelerated through the use of transistors rather than  chemiresistors for gas sensing   For ﬂ exible sensors operating in aqueous media, a wide  variety of biologically relevant analytes have already been  detected A solution gate is commonly used to increase sensi- tivity in these devices; however, little progress has been made  in miniaturizing these gate electrodes, making them unsuit- able for e-skin applications at this time

 Additionally, the use  of protein-based receptor groups limits the shelf life of these  sensors and imposes restrictive storage conditions, although  immobilizing them on polysaccharide supports have been  shown to slow device degradation [ 425 ]  Otherwise, the replace- ment of protein-based receptors with more stable organic mol- ecules such as DNA aptamers or inorganic catalytic NPs can be  used to increase the lifetime of the device Finally, the ability  to accommodate bending fatigue is crucial for practical e-skin  applications, but has yet to be thoroughly investigated   Other desirable properties, including biocompatibility and  biodegradability, self-healing, temperature sensitivity, and self- powering are also currently being developed for implementa- tion into e-skin The use of bio-resorbable materials would  allow for the fabrication of transient electronics with program- mable lifetimes By contrast, e-skin with self-healing capa- bilities would allow for the ability to repair mechanical and  electrical damage, allowing such electronics to last a lifetime  Temperature sensors, often incorporated in conjunction with  tactile sensors, would be highly useful in e-skin Finally, the  prospect of self-powering e-skins made possible through the  incorporation of devices such as solar cells, mechanical energy  harvesters, supercapacitors, batteries, and wireless antennas  would allow a degree of autonomy not possible with an immo- bile power source   While tremendous effort has been concentrated on devel- oping e-skin hardware, its true value is derived from effective  digitization, which requires software to provide a communica- tion interface with the user The signals produced from sen- sors in e-skins are analog, and signal digitization is required  for interfacing with modern digital microprocessors Ideally,  digitization would be performed at the sensor device level in  a manner that does not require considerable power consump- tion in order to integrate a large density of sensors (>100 cm −2 )  After digitization, software algorithms could be used to process,  interpret, and act on the large amounts of data in a coherent  fashion Further integration of other signal processing methods  (such as wireless technologies) could be used to create super  skins, such as implantable biofeedback devices for healthcare  applications Future work in the development of e-skin will  most certainly require concentrated and multi-disciplinary  spatial resolution to human skin, [ 23b ]  and tactile and tempera- ture sensors are available with enhanced sensitivity over their  natural counterpart [ 18,392 ]    Despite rapid progress, there is a continuing need for further  development before the goal of integrating multiple function- alities into large-area, low-cost sensor arrays is realized From  a design standpoint, e-skin requires active circuitry to address  large numbers of devices with minimal wiring complexity and  fast scan rates Furthermore, the ability to mimic the mechan- ical properties of human skin (eg, ﬂ exibility and stretchability)  is critical in order to accommodate the various movements of  the user This can be accomplished through the use of intrin- sically stretchable materials or rigid device islands tethered  together through ﬂ exible interconnects While the latter lev- erages the extensive optimization of rigid devices, the former  may have advantages in terms of cost and robustness   One of the most important functions of skin is to facili- tate the sense of touch, which includes normal force sensing  for grip optimization, tensile strain sensing for propriocep- tion, shear force sensing for object manipulation, and vibra- tion sensing for slip detection and texture analysis While the  commonly used transduction methods (such as piezoresis- tive, capacitive, piezoelectric, optical, and wireless) are readily  available, advancements in device structures and materials  have produced dramatic improvements in tactile sensor  performance For example, improvements in processes to  create microstructured and nanostructured materials have  presented exciting opportunities for smaller devices suit- able for high-density arrays [ 23b ]  with low power consumption  and excellent performance [ 18 ]  However, further optimization  of materials and device conﬁ  gurations is still necessary For  example, the piezoresistive composites that are currently  used in some integrated systems [ 15b,23a ]  display viscoelasticity  that may potentially be overcome using matrix-free structures  of nanomaterials   Different transduction methods provide different sensing  capabilities, thus allowing integrated systems to mimic the  multifunctional nature of human tactile sensing capabilities  For example, large strains can be reliably measured using  piezoresistive devices, [ 188 ]  capacitive devices can provide high  sensitivity to normal forces, and piezoelectrics can measure  vibrations

 Integration and readout is one of the most impor- tant development areas for large area sensor arrays Active  matrices have been developed that provide a method of mul- tiplexing large arrays with fast addressing and minimal cross- talk between pixels [ 15b,136b ]  Future work will probably involve  continuing efforts to improve the performance and reduce the  cost of tactile devices integrated with transistor matrices Fur- thermore, integrating multiple functionalities (such as temper- ature, shear, and vibration sensing) with active matrix arrays is  an area of tremendous opportunity   Concomitantly, the properties of human skin can be aug- mented by incorporating both chemical and biological sen- sors into e-skins Several ﬂ exible chemical and biological sen- sors have been reported for the detection of both gas- and  liquid-phase analytes Flexible chemiresistors and transistor- based sensors for gas detection have sensitivities on a par  with their inﬂ exible counterparts However, most sensors  have to be operated in controlled, inert environments owing  Adv Mater 2013, 25, 5997–6038  15214095, 2013, 42, Downloaded from https://advancedonlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101002/adma201302240 by Fudan University, Wiley Online Library on [05/02/2025] See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrarywileycom/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 6028 wileyonlinelibrarycom © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim REVIEW wwwadvmatde research efforts, using the human skin and other living organ- isms as excellent example models   Several highly integrated e-skins demonstrating multiple  functionalities for applications such as biomedical devices,  robotics, and optoelectronics have been recently reported  One particular challenge in the future of e-skin will be  neural interfacing [ 426 ]  Work has already begun to overcome  this obstacle, and recently, a neurally controlled robotic arm  capable of 3D reach and grasp movements was reported [ 427 ]   Additionally, a bionic ear has been demonstrated with the  capability to receive RF signals beyond that of the human  ear [ 428 ]  The rapid pace of progress in e-skin technology sug- gests that the fabrication of a more complex e-skin with prop- erties far surpassing those of their organic equivalent will  soon be possible     Acknowledgements   This article is part of an ongoing series celebrating the 25 th anniversary  of Advanced Materials  MLH acknowledges support from a National  Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship (32 CFR  168a) and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship  BC-KT acknowledges support from the National Science Scholarship  (NSS) from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)  The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Science Foundation (ECCS  1101901), Air Force Ofﬁ ce of Scientiﬁ c Research (FA9550–12–1–0190),  LG Display, Kuraray Corporation and Samsung Advanced Research Institute  for funding the above described research activities in our laboratory    [12]     V J    Lumelsky  ,   M S    Shur  ,   S    Wagner  ,  IEEE Sensors J    2001 ,  1 ,  41    [13]   a)   S P    Lacour  ,   S    Wagner  ,   Z Y     Huang  ,   Z    Suo  ,  Appl Phys Lett      2003 ,  82 ,  2404 ;   b)   S    Wagner  ,   S P    Lacour  ,   J    Jones  ,   P H I    Hsu  ,    J C    Sturm  ,   T    Li  ,   Z G    Suo  ,  Phys E    2004 ,  25 ,  326 ;   c)   S P    Lacour  ,    J    Jones  ,   S    Wagner  ,   T    Li  ,   Z G    Suo  ,  Proc IEEE    2005 ,  93 ,  1459    [14]   a)   D-H    Kim  ,   J    Song  ,   W M    Choi  ,   H-S    Kim  ,   R-H    Kim  ,   Z    Liu  ,    Y  Y     Huang  ,   K-C    Hwang  ,   Y -W    Zhang  ,   J A    Rogers  ,  Proc Natl  Acad Sci USA     2008 ,  105 ,  18675 ;   b)   D-H    Kim  ,   J-H    Ahn  ,    W M    Choi  ,   H-S    Kim  ,   T-H    Kim  ,   J    Song  ,   Y  Y     Huang  ,   Z    Liu  ,    C    Lu  ,   J A    Rogers  ,  Science    2008 ,  320 ,  507 ;   c)   D-H    Kim  ,   J    Xiao  ,    J    Song  ,   Y     Huang  ,   J A    Rogers  ,  Adv Mater    2010 ,  22 ,  2108    [15]   a)   T    Someya  ,   Y     Kato  ,   T    Sekitani  ,   S    Iba  ,   Y     Noguchi  ,   Y     Murase  ,    H    Kawaguchi  ,   T    Sakurai  ,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA     2005 ,  102 ,   12321 ;   b)   T    Sekitani  ,   Y     Noguchi  ,   K    Hata  ,   T    Fukushima  ,   T    Aida  ,    T    Someya  ,  Science    2008 ,  321 ,  1468 ;   c)   T    Sekitani  ,   T    Yokota  ,    U    Zschieschang  ,   H    Klauk  ,   S    Bauer  ,   K    Takeuchi  ,   M    Takamiya  ,    T    Sakurai  ,   T    Someya  ,  Science    2009 ,  326 ,  1516    [16]     C    Metzger  ,   E    Fleisch  ,   J    Meyer  ,   M    Dansachmueller  ,   I    Graz  ,    M    Kaltenbrunner  ,   C    Keplinger  ,   R    Schwoediauer  ,   S    Bauer  ,  Appl  Phys Lett    2008 ,  92 ,  013506    [17]     I    Graz  ,   M
